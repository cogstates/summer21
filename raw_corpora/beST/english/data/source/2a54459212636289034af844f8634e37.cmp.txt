Juan Manuel Marquez has waited four long years but believes he is ready to avenge his drawn bout against Manny Pacquiao in the upcoming WBC super featherweight title re-match.

Marquez will re-ignite his rivalry with the Filipino fighter at Mandalay Bay on March 15, and the Mexican is adamant he will go one better when the pair re-unite in Las Vegas.

"Well I can tell you that I'm a better fighter. I'm a more technical fighter, in better condition, and I proved it in the first fight," said Marquez.

"Watching the first fight I saw that Manny Pacquiao was getting tired, and I wasn't. I was in my prime throughout the fight.

If anyone saw the first fight it was amazing seeing marquez get knocked down to the floor in the opening round 3 times, too be honest i think marquez should have won that fight, but it was given a draw, epic battle it was, and hopefully this second fight will not dissapoint either

so whose watching this fight and who do you think will win

WHAT A FIGHT IT WAS
better than the first one

Pacquiao won though there will def be a 3rd as there was a debate if the points were fair. which i dont think they were i think marquez nicked it by a round @ least

Arums been waiting to feed Diaz to Manny next. Pacs lost that ferocity he had when he first went to the states, too much partying I think. I had Manny up by one though, couldnt argue with a draw or Marquez by one though.
