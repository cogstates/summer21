You've made that point fifty million times now. And it isn't even relevant.

Britain also gained enormously from other colonies such as the USA and Canada, but it isn't giving aid to those countries.

Reasons:

1) There is no politicial motive / need / purpose in doing so.
2) There is not extensive poverty which is needed to justify the giving of aid on humanitarian grounds.

Life IS all about conquering and it will never change. If you dont believe this please explain to me what Russia and China will do when oil starts to deplete? Negotiate? Dont make me laugh...

The Smith and the Jones children are now all grown up, and whilst the Jones children have inherited a lot of money from their dad the Smith children are still poverty striken.

Do you think that morally the Jones children have any obligation to give back to the Smith's the ill gotten money they inherited from their father?

In that case the Italians have a moral obligation to us for benefitting from the Roman expoitation of Britain.

The Roman empire =/= Modern Italy.
Besides there is a difference between something thousands of years ago and something quite recent that is easier to measure.

I don't believe they are giving this aid for entirely charitable reasons.

To put in bluntly its like a bribe. India is very poor person but the economy has been growing massively in the past 10 years.

As people have said India buys arms from overseas. The UK is one of the worlds biggest arms suppliers so they want to increase sales. Also as India middle class grows they will buy more consumer goods - the UK will want a piece of this pie.

World and Regional politics also play a role. India is a very important country in that region so its useful for British interests to have close relations especially with our troops in Afghanistan. In the future China may be a threat to Western interests.

Just like the UK India suffers from terrorism coming from Pakistan. Close cooperation will benefit both countries. Some poster said we should give the money to Pakistan- why? - so they can send more people here to blow themselves up?

So there are a number of reasons why its in the UK's interests to give this money.

So for the record you believe that when oil becomes scarce, Russia, China and the US will sit down and calculate how to split oil evenly?

Yes?
