He is cutting spending. Isn't that what you want?
Sheesh, some will bitch if you hang them with a new rope.

You must be daffed.

I think cutting the nonessentials would be fine...but cutting our defense budget during two wars and in essence grounding us isn't exactly very bright.

Iran is sending rodents into space but we won't be able to send so much as a microbe into space without the Russians permission.

How quickly one skinny bastard can destroy everything that made this country great.

The technology that you use to communicate was made possible by advancements in space. Cell phones, computers, micro-chips. None of it would exist if it wasn't used to reduce weight on our spacecraft.

You know Obama in fact increased defense spending, right?

Muddy also seems confused between the space program and military defense programs. The purpose of the space program isn't to install WMD on the moon capable of blowing up certain countries. As he does correctly point out, the space program does provide us with technology, some of which deters war or even prevents the threat of war.

Can anyone explain to me how the Russians have "caught up" ?

- We have the most powerful Air Force (and Naval Air) on earth
- We have the most advanced avionics
- We have the best missiles
- We have the best intelligence
- We have air superiority in any theater on earth

The Russians tried for 50 years to keep up with us and they couldn't. What makes you think they are our equal now or anytime in the forseeable future?

some just want America to fail.

We must be vigilant against enemies both domestic and foreign.

Obviously you have been napping on the job because one of them currently works out of the Oval Office.

Not one speech he's given tells me he loves this country.

The only thing he talks about is how screwed up it's been. Yet he doesn't seem to have anything better to offer.

You're hearing only what you want to hear and imagining the rest. I'm always amused when someone apparently likes to advertise how much he doesn't pay attention.

Yet another thread on this topic, first lets get this straight the Presidents budget did not cut any MONEY, it CUT and re-tasked program(s) within NASA and the DoD. In fact the President raised the funding, so why then would Republicans be for any of that based on a fiscal level when it adds to the deficit and accomplishes NOTHING. Starting with the F-22 and ending it's production at 187 in favor of the F-35 which by the way is an average aircraft at best in terms of performance and the US Navy is calling into question operating costs on that aircraft and due to these factors Sec. Gates yesterday fired the program manager for the F-35 project and is holding back 614 million in funding until these issues are addressed. One of those issues is the F-35's failure to perform well against current Russian, American, and EU 4th generation fighters. The Cut in the Constellation program will result in the US after the shuttles last flight this year, having to rely on Russia to provide lifting and resupply needs to the ISS which is a several billion dollar US investment. Further the US will be unable for the forseeable future to service the HST ( Hubble Space Telescope) as well as communications, GPS, and it's own sat. networks without assistance. We will have launch only capability with the Delta series rockets but no manned capability. That is is a FACT. Now if those of you who think that "outsourcing" our space flight needs to other nations at the expense of American security, jobs, and science is a good thing, then by all means continue to celebrate mediocrity.

Go to NasaWatch home page. Seems there isn't a whole lot of disagreement with this decision after all. And this was of particular interest. (I thought conservatives WANTED private enterprise to do all the heavy lifting?)

I'm aware of the 50 million given to Space-X for the CRV in fact I already posted the information on it in another thread. One other thing, the reason why most like me think private enterprise is the ONLY way to go now is because our Govt. does not have the vision or the courage to sustain a program like Apollo. If you work in the research part of NASA, Ames etc. I'm sure your overjoyed at this decision, however, I would suggest you see how well this decision is goping over at Johnson and Huntsville. Further, the former director of NASA might disagree with that assertion as well.
