It's the way he coached and ran that team as a family. Very few programs achieve that level of big-time football success with such a high level of academic success. Skip class? You're benched. Fail a class? Benched, or off the team. Want your name on your jersey? Go somewhere else; we're a team. The whole "We are Penn State" thing came from an incident in which the team was set to play in the segregated South and one or more of their African American players were taking heat. The team's response was that all of them, black and white, were integral to that team identity. It was a gutsy show of solidarity against institutionalized racism.

Through the years, Joe could've made tons more money. He could've recruited better athletes and won more championships. But he had a love of that community - to which he's donated millions - and a dedication to honor first, and winning second.

That's why it's so painful now to learn that in this critical instance Joe's moral compass sent him to the Bermuda Triangle. He really is a superb human being, but in this case he flat out failed to live up to anything near his own code of honor. That's the tragic irony and the cognitive dissonance here.

Well said, thanks. He is certainly not faultless here and he knows and has said as much; his punishment is far more than a sad ending to an unmatched and otherwise extremely honorable career. It's living with knowing he could have done more.

I would examine the evidence available and then make my mind up. If I thought a member of my family or circle of friends had responded as was described in the Grand Jury paper I would be more angry than I would on learning of a similar set of circumstances involving a work colleague.

Good idea, although I'm betting initially you would assume innocence and need one heckuva a case and a LOT of evidence to be swayed otherwise. And there is little evidence in this right now. There are accusations and testimonials only. Strong stuff but IMO not nearly enough to *BANG* stop or I'll shoot.

I just think it would have been nice/advisable to have this go to court and KNOW what's what before people started throwing molotov cocktails every which way.

He has been in a position of knowing he could have done more for the last (around) 10 years so I don't see why it should now start being a punishment?

Sandusky was not one of this staff.

oops, sorry, I threw another fact in there. I keep forgetting they don't matter in this issue.

I agree. My problem hasn't been with any of this, but the way people have been acting like his failing was some unthinkably extreme character deficiency. My real position is that human nature is horrible, from our rational moral principle perspective. This man's character is no more scummy than one's neighbour, who honestly is probably sitting on a similar story about Uncle Joe. And by "no more" I mean just as scummy, just under the right bizarre influences.

That's the point I was making earlier when I said I could understand why he did not take immediate action when he saw the child being raped and I accept that is how humans can react in such stressful circumstances.

But that only covers the immediate reaction, from what others have posted it seems that for years after witnessing the child being raped he would have seen the rapist with young children. Given that I do think it is right to conclude that to not have taken further action over that timespan is a character flaw.

It is soooo easy to sit here all comfy behind a computer with the luxury of hindsight and chit chatter away about I woulda done the exact right thing at the exact right time blah blah blah. But when something this shocking blindsides you in an instant, FYI it might not be so easy/simple and being human you might not take the best path.

I do not excuse anyone in this situation who didn't, btw. Just something to think about.
