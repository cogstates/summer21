It's been a long time since I saw the show, but from what I recall, I didn't take away that message from it. I just remember it being about a father trying to find out what really happened to his daughter, and Joe Don Baker's radioactive act of revenge towards the end. I also recall it being a very well-made program.

It is indeed great! Especially Bob Peck's acting, as Ronald Craven, and the character Darius Jedburg (I am guessing this is Joe Don Baker).

You're also right that it was about Bob Peck's uncovering of stranger and stranger circumstances behind his daughter's death but throughout the series he is "visited" by his daughter who was, in life, some kind of environmental activist for a group called "GAIA" who tells him some story about "black flowers" which somehow kill everyone off. I think at some point Jedburg says he saw the same flowers in Afghanistan and thinks there may be some truth to this. It is somewhat subtle and I probably wouldn't have noticed it had I not watched it recently but it is, I think, something of the moral message to the TV series.

I agree though, that the series was really well-made.

Looks like I'm not the only one who's been reminded of it either:

I'm sure this has come up already but could someone tell me, in a nutshell, what was so disastrous about Three Mile Island.

I've known the name for a while as the name of an extraordinarily bad event but I haven't found any references to casualties in my (albeit) cursory search.

§ The plant is safe now and will stay safe.
§ Japan is looking at an INES Level 4 Accident: Nuclear accident with local consequences. That is bad for the company that owns the plant, but not for anyone else.
§ Some radiation was released when the pressure vessel was vented. All radioactive isotopes from the activated steam have gone (decayed). A very small amount of Cesium was released, as well as Iodine. If you were sitting on top of the plants chimney when they were venting, you should probably give up smoking to return to your former life expectancy. The Cesium and Iodine isotopes were carried out to the sea and will never be seen again.
§ There was some limited damage to the first containment. That means that some amounts of radioactive Cesium and Iodine will also be released into the cooling water, but no Uranium or other nasty stuff (the Uranium oxide does not dissolve in the water). There are facilities for treating the cooling water inside the third containment. The radioactive Cesium and Iodine will be removed there and eventually stored as radioactive waste in terminal storage.
§ The seawater used as cooling water will be activated to some degree. Because the control rods are fully inserted, the Uranium chain reaction is not happening. That means the main nuclear reaction is not happening, thus not contributing to the activation. The intermediate radioactive materials (Cesium and Iodine) are also almost gone at this stage, because the Uranium decay was stopped a long time ago. This further reduces the activation. The bottom line is that there will be some low level of activation of the seawater, which will also be removed by the treatment facilities.
§ The seawater will then be replaced over time with the normal cooling water
§ The reactor core will then be dismantled and transported to a processing facility, just like during a regular fuel change.
§ Fuel rods and the entire plant will be checked for potential damage. This will take about 4-5 years.
§ The safety systems on all Japanese plants will be upgraded to withstand a 9.0 earthquake and tsunami (or worse)

See these posts for some detailed pictures and explanations.

Skwinty... sounds as if the reactor cores are being directly flooded with seawater.

Reactor cores are not generally flooded with coolant I assume.

Is this seawater being circulated somehow do you know? Thanks.

Only this afternoon there was an item about the fact that many (petro-chemical) pollutants were washed over crop fields because of the debris carried by the tsunami.

Most forms of petro chemical polution of agricultural soils have a tendency to abate over time due to bio-degradation. It is even possible to remediate heavy metal polution through bio remidiation. Although, it is likely that most of these feilds will need to be taken out of production for a while.

The power plant itself was the only real casualty.

I was listening to a harrowing account of an elderly women looking through the wreckage of her home for her husband's medal (he had died 100 days before) and one of the journalist's descriptions turned to the globules of tarry petrochemicals dripping from everywhere. The local refinery had exploded before catching fire, how much damage is that type of pollution going to cause?

Yes a nuclear reactor malfunctioning is very worrying - especially one so old - but I suspect that compared to the pollution caused by everything else as a result of the tsunami and earthquake it will be almost insignificant.

Ah, but it has the word "nuclear" in it !!!
