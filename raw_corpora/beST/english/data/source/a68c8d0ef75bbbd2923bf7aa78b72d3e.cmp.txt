1. Dumbass "he didn't check to see if the gun was loaded"

They're always loaded, idiot.

Gee, what could possibly go wrong if firearms are allowed on campus?

On edit after reading the complete article:

He was headed to the range with a Taurus Judge loaded with shotgun shells? What was he gonna shoot at, rabbits?

3. Yet another reason to keep guns off the U of A campus! Thank goodness no one else was hurt.
Unlike that incident with Professor Locke.
