A friend gave me two New Zealand Whites after my dog passed away. I've named them Onion and Cricket.

From freecycle, I got a mini rex (I think) that is now named Bumble Bee.

A friends sons passed away recently (16 &amp; 17 years old, in a car wreck) and I inherited four French Angoras. I have yet to name them.
