Habemus Papademos!

Finally after days of intense political infight in Athens the new prime minister seems to be the biggest favourite for the job: Lucas Papademos. He is an ex-ECB vice president. But foremost he is not a career politician as his profession is actually an academic one, partly in the US where he also studied. Papademos seems to be well respected in the EU but also within Greece, as far as a Greek Prime minister could be respected in a country like Greece where being politician has a worse reputation than being a bank robber.

I am positively surprised about this choice. At least someone took over who has an understanding of economics in quite some detail and is not from the old political class. I don't think one could have hoped for anything better than that.

On another note. There are rumors that Mario Monti could become the next prime minister of Italy. Monti, also dubbed "Super Mario", is a former EU commissioner and will still ring some bells for example in Redmond, simply because it was him who did not shy away from taking a fight with an extreme heavyweight like Microsoft over anti-trust issues. (Same goes for companies like VW etc).

If both news would be true, this would make the dark horizon look a little less dark indeed. These two men would be the best choice for their respective countries in times like these in my humble opinion. They know economics, have a reputation of being not involved in corruption, dare to do what they believe has to be done and are convinced Europeans.

Personally i was hoping for Eva Kaili, but obviously for different reasons. <img src="http://www.uspoliticsonline.com/images/smilies/wink.gif"/>

He wasn't the head of the ECB but one of the Vice Presidents, ie in the governing council of the ECB. For all the shortcomings of the Euro, I can't see how the ECB has done a bad job. He seems to be a really clever guy, understanding economics like few prime ministers in the world probably, as he teaches it in Harvard I think.

Eva Kaili would have been a great choice. Well at least it would have made the newspapers look more interesting...

Yeah, you're telling me! *drool* She may be a socialist, but at least she's a hot one! <img src="http://www.uspoliticsonline.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif"/>

I guess the Vice chair of the ECB doesn't post quite as big a conflict of interests but having such a close knit position to the financial lifelines of Greece would lead many to jump to the wrong conclusion i think. Whilst he probably has never done anything inappropriate, the perception is terrible to have the ECB #2 or #3 take over the country with effectively the continent's worst economy...

She seems to be really your type, doesn't she?

Well, she's not the most attractive woman in the world but for a politician there aren't many hotter out there...she must get lost in my posts, what with the other women and all. I think i have a thing for blonde women...anyhow, so seeing as i can find myself talking positively about a socialist like this, isn't it your turn to talk about Palin like this in threads about the Tea Party? <img src="http://www.uspoliticsonline.com/images/smilies/wink.gif"/>

Btw, i think given her experience in journalism and TV media, she would have done a good job relaying the message of what the essential need of bailout measures were, to the Greek people. She also was very respectful in her final days of dissent in the previous coallition, and didn't even call for him to resign. That i can respect.

It's a very good idea to have a former ECB man in the job. We have too many bureaucrats and lawyers and career politicians in charge of economic matters. It is good to see someone with economic experience.
