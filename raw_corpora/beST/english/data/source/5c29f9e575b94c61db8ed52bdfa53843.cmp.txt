MLK talked about the war in Vietnam and how cruel it was how many people were mutilated and so on, now Obama is waging war against Libya, all people see is how he is black.

Am I the only one who sees he is crooked and a war mongerer like Bush and Tony.

He also denies Palestine statehood, he is NO CHANGE!

The picture sums him up completely.

Forgetting that Hitler killed and hated people of African/and Caribbean origin. <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:"/>

I don't think having the authority of the United Nations, NATO, Libyan transnational council and Arab League. Compares fairly with Bush and Blair's adventures in Iraq. But oh well, no amount of rational discussion will convince you anyway. The international community demanded action and in response Obama sought international backing and got it. If he had not responded and thousands of more Libyan people were slaughtered you'd be making a thread attacking him for letting innocent people die and not giving a damn. He can't win with people like you.

Please propose a different solution to stopping tyrannical leaders from slaughtering their citizens indiscriminately. Do we send them a Facebook message to surrender? do we make 'important' threads on TSR decrying their actions? what do we do exactly? watch and wait for...what? after every national, supranational and international spokesperson has demanded cease fire and for the civilians to be left alone in peace. What the hell do we do next? add them on facebook?

It was up to the Libyans to stop the dictator, not war mongering NATO.

That is what revolution is.

Ah so your solution is for the international community to watch massacres take place and if you have the will to stop it, just do nothing. Amazing. Thank you for ignoring the fact that NATO got permission from the UN and Arab League. Even refusing to take action until it had done so. Because of course this wouldn't fit your anti NATO agenda.

Many countries were uneasy about the decision, even China and Russia and their human rights record speaks for itself.

The UN had little time to make a decision, basically the UN should of allowed the rebels to take control on THEIR OWN. Not any intervention, I knew it would of cost more lives and it did.

You have no evidence to prove that if the international community did not intervene it would have prevented more civilian deaths. Stop acting as if you have a magical crystal ball., because you don't. People can only judge the situation and weigh up the consequences of action and inaction. You thought it was perfectly okay for the world to not take action, that's your view but not mine.

He still authorised Operation Eagle Claw, that failed and ended up with the deaths of american soldiers. Plus, this fails to mention any covert operations which we are not in public knowledge.
