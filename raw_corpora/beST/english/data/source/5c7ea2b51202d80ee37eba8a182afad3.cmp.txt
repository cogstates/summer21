hello,

just looking for some more advice on my situation. I was recently made redundant a week after announcing my pregnancy.

After receiving legal advice I have been advised to send a letter to my employer highlighting that I wish to appeal their decision. Does anyone have any idea where I can find a template letter to follow and also whether the fact I was a temporary employer matters when it comes to appealing a decision.

Many Thanks
