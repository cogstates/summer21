I'm frankly not surprised you feel the need to insult me.

The nation state is humanities most effective form of societal organization. It is what has allowed the West to become so powerful, and so prosperous.

As a citizen you have signed an implicit contract with the nation state. You are, in effect, its partner, and a partner with every other citizen. Your safety, you livelihood, and your freedom to act are all dependent upon the stability and success of the state in which you reside.

If your state happens to be successful, that is, if it happens to grant you a safe living environment, support against life's ills, and the right to express yourself, then of course you should feel a connection to it.

You should desire that it remains powerful enough to continue providing these luxuries which do not exist elsewhere, you should desire that it becomes even better, and you should take pride in it.

Pride, patriotism, nationalism, whatever you want to call it, is what built the British state. Like it or not.

If nobody cared about what happened to Britain, then Britain wouldn't exist.

You're kidding, right? Where did I insult you? And you think I "signed an implicit contract" what the hell are you smoking? So, whilst swimming in the womb, some god of Britain floated down to join me, handed me a pen and paper and said "you can be born here, but only if you agree to our rules"? I did not CHOOSE to be born in this country. I owe this country NOTHING. Frankly, I find your attitude sickening.

Pride, patriotism and nationalism are holding the species back. Only when they are defeated (and they will be) can we truly fulfil our potential.

You claim the Argentinian army is useless, provide no evidence to back up your claim, and that attack me for not being knowledgeable.

Ok...

Ok,...let's put it into context.

In 1981, Argentina was ruled by the military from what I remember. They sent their best forces and got annihilated.

Today, an overestimated Argentinian military expenditure is about 5 billion dollars. An underestimate of British expenditure is about 60 billion dollars.

So, they really have no chance. I am not going to waste any more time on the issue on imaginary scenarios of Argentinian Espionage when they do not even have a military budget to defend their own country.

No, we shouldn't. But there's no need to react militarily to the problem, when the Argentinians won't be able to keep up that activity for long in the first place. We can send extra forces to the garrison, send an extra frigate down there, schedule some training for another battalion, perhaps even send a high profile member of the Royal Family down there [hmm....... <img src="images/smilies/wink.png"/> ] and gently remind Argentina what they already know: that they can't do anything other than shout.

The British people know full well that we can't afford endless operations, but that our Armed Forces have the strength required to resist any attack. The rest of the world couldn't care less.

Britain is without an aircraft carrier for the first time, and is downsizing significantly its armed forces.

The message Britain sends to the rest of the world when it responds with diplomatic "complaints" to blockades and embassy sackings is one of weakness.

The British, if they are as capable as you say they are, should send ships to end the blockade.

You didn't choose to, your parents, grandparents, on ancestors did when they helped to found/moved to this country.

Since you cannot consent until the age of 18, your parents, being your guardians, are the ones who decided for you to have British citizenship by having a child here.

If you wish to renounce your parents decision, and hence your citizenship, you are free to do so.

I get the sense you won't, though, because even though you claim this country owes you nothing, we both know that isn't true.

You were raised in a safe, prosperous, liberal environment that most of the world would be lucky to call home. For you to pretend that such a privilege is worthless is an insult to the majority of humanity who cannot call a place like Britain home.

What proportion of that 60 billion dollars do you think is spent on the Falklands?
