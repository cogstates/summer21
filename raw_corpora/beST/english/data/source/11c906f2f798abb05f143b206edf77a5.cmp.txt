Loss of 2,400 jobs at Pfizer in Sandwich, Kent....massive impact on employment in local area...loss of confidence in UK...

Now that Pfizer has decided to close their massive operations centre in east Kent, impacting markedly on jobs and doubling the unemployment figures in one of the most deprived areas in the country...what now for that area and the rest of the UK as far as chemistry-related interests are concerned?

Only four weeks ago, Cameron claimed that the two biggest pharmaceutical research centres in the country were committed to sustaining interests in the UK...and yet, here we are, four weeks later with broken promises.

Whilst this Tory-led government claim to be working hard towards promoting growth from within the private sector, this example says far more about their failure to do so than any spin from Downing Street, to the contrary.

Any pundits got an opinion?

I'm expecting the usual apologetics from the Tories/LibDems, but putting aside political partisanship, can anyone claim that this news is not devastating to economic recovery, remembering that the plant at Sandwich is not a viable enterprise because of being contaminated? ( You need to be a local to know the levels of contanimation in the area and it's deleterious impact on the surrounding environment and animal/wild life.) <img src="images/smilies/frown.png"/>

Excuse me? I've heard nothing of this widespread contamination - care to explain a little more? And if it's so bad it's hardly surprising that they want to leave is it. Your argument is rather confusing, it's a contaminated, non-viable enterprise and you're shocked they want to leave?

They have announced that the closure was nothing to do with government policy. You can claim they are lying if you want (why they would I have no idea).

And just for future reference, calling anyone putting forward an argument against you a "government apologist" basically destroys any argument you make, because the person reading the post (well, me anyway) is just thinking how childish and obtuse your being instead of evaluating any good points you may have had.

Unfortunately, not all of the 2,400 staff are high earning chemists. Most of them are blue collar workers....and redundancy payments have been cut by this government anyway.

And it's got absolutely nothing to do with years of incompetency and lack of initiative by the previous labour administration to put in place transport links as promised on time...

Let me guess, this is Egypt all over again!!!! <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/woo.gif" alt=":woo:"/>

Your hyperbole and complete and utter stupidity knows no bounds <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/facepalm.gif" alt=":facepalm:"/>

It's ridiculous to see that cheap labour is being chosen over safety and security...not saying that India isn't but it's true what they say, you get what you pay for:
CHEAP pharmaceutics production = low quality...

This is what happens when people price themselves out of the market. Why should a business be forced to stay in a location where people demand higher wages, when there are people who will work for less elsewhere. It's simply how labour markets work.
