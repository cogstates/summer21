Technically A Clinton Clinton Ticket Would Be Legal.

Interestingly the idea came up on Chicago progressive talk radio. Apparently the law says Clinton could not be "elected" to t third term. Theoretically Bill Clinton could be run for VP. And if something happened to Hillary he could become president. And that would be legal.

Boy would such a ticket have the GOP and RW going completely insane. LOL

13. Check the 12th Amendment.  This was brought up when Bush and Cheney were both "from" Texas.

The Electors shall meet in their respective states, and vote by ballot for President and Vice-President, one of whom, at least, shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves; they shall name in their ballots the person voted for as President, and in distinct ballots the person voted for as Vice-President, and they shall make distinct lists of all persons voted for as President, and all persons voted for as Vice-President and of the number of votes for each, which lists they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate.

30. Yes and no.

It means that the electoral votes from NY couldn't go to both Clintons. Assuming the electors of NY vote for Hillary, they COULDN'T vote for Bill for the VP. New York has 31 electoral votes, and if Clinton's margin of Victory is LESS than 31, then you could have president Clinton with a Republican vice president (having gotten the most votes for VP).

You're correct in that it's not specifically barred, and if the Clintons were both from Wyoming, it wouldn't be a big issue, but with 31 elector votes at stake (and for a host of other reasons), it's not going to happen.

36. He could simply change his home state something else

How hard could it be for him to have Arkansas like Cheney changed from Texas to Wyoming. I doubt it will happen but doubt it is much of a roadblock.

45. Is it worth it, though?

I'll bet the last thing Hillary wants is her husband as VP. Not to mention the field day the press would have with a married couple not even "living the the same state".

47. I don't think it will happen in reality

just don't think the changing the home states issue will be the reason why they don't. Like you said it would be controversial considering he did serve 2 terms &amp; things like what the would press would say, etc

6. Interesting question....

The 22nd Amendment only forbids being ELECTED President more than twice. If he ran for Veep, he wouldn't be elected President.

Not that any of this matters. He'll never do it, Hillary would never ask him, and it wouldn't be a good thing if he did, IMO.

17. They'd have to move to do it

The Constitution says the electors cast ballots for a president and VP, at least one of whom is from a different state than the elector is. Most folks translate that to mean the two politicians can't be from the same state. No, what it means is, if Mike Crapo and Raul Labrador were the Republican candidates they could not receive Idaho's four votes. In practical application it'll never be tested because no one wants to write off a whole state.

If Bill were to pull $125,000 out of the bank and buy a house in Bald Knob, AR, he could declare as an Arkansas resident but it still looks flaky to me; have we no bench?

31. "Technically" it's a grey area that would unquestionably go to the Supreme Court

People have played "what if" scenarios with the 22nd Amendment ever since it was passed in 1947. While both sides of the argument adamantly proclaim that they're right, the reality is that the law is vague and won't be clarified until the Supreme Court chimes in. That probably won't happen until somebody gives it a try.

Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution defines "eligibility" to be President. It sets age requirements, residency requirements and citizenship requirements.

The 22nd Amendment, by its wording, prohibits a person from being ELECTED to the office of President. It does not contain any reference to eligibility, and has no wording stating that a person is ineligible to hold the office after two terms. Its wording is specific in that it refers to being "elected".

the 12th Amendment states that nobody ineligible to serve as President can serve as Vice President.

The debate revolves around the word "ineligible". While theintentof the 22nd Amendment was clear, thewordingcreates a loophole in that it technically does not make a two term President "ineligible", but merely "unelectable". Generally, the camps in the argument fall into a camp that supports its "implied meaning" and intent, and another camp that is strictly reading the letter of the law itself.

While it's a fun topic to debate, we'll never see this sort of thing actually happen. Because it would unquestionably go to the Supreme Court, there's a 50/50 chance that the VP would be thrown out of office within days of the election. That would put the newly elected President into a nightmare scenario of having to select a new nominee for Vice President, and then having Congress approve it. If you think that getting federal judges, cabinet members, and Supreme Court justices approved is a nightmare, can you imagine what would happen today if Congress were allowed to vet and approve the Vice President? No party is going to risk that, no matter how well liked their former two-term President may be. It would take political gridlock to an entirely new level.
