14 is illegal, same as 10, both are morally wrong and disgusting.

If he agreed to do it under the illusion it was a real 14 year old, how do we know he hasn't already done it before, or wouldn't in the future, he must have been looking to have stumbled across the 14 yr old police woman.

I think its a good thing

yeah its totally a good thing that police are allowed to trick people to get convictions

He should be arrested, if he knew she was 14 (like some have said, she could have sent older-looking pics and lied about her age).

I don't think the police are wrong for the method they used. Why wait for 14 year olds to be raped or w.e before arresting people? Surely it's better to be safe than sorry on serious matters like this?

Paedophile or not, arranging to meet with a 14 year old for sex is ****ing wrong and he knows it, so he should rightly be punished.

Anyone that disagrees needs their head testing, or locking up !

lol ok, this is starting to sound like a dictatorship.. tricking people into "comitting crimes" and locking away anyone who disagrees.

he is not a paedophile because she isn't pre pubescent... i'm not saying it isn't wrong i'm saying paedophilia is a strong word and not the right one to use.

Not this debate again <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:"/> can we not accept that "paedophile" is used as a sort of umbrella term

i'm not disagreeing that it is wrong, but i don't think coaxing someone into doing something they might not otherwise do, which is the impression that the article give, is a good way about catching "criminals"...

maybe my interpretation of the article is wrong or maybe the author isn't very clear... but i don't think it's right that you can basically reel someone in to POTENTIALLY comitting a crime (he did not sleep with a 14 year old) then arrest them on that basis.

it's short but if you don't want to read it basically a guy in the USA has been arrested for agreeing to meet up with and have sex with a "14 year old girl" who was actually an undercover cop...

surely this is entrapment? he didn't actually do anything because they basically lead him into the situation? sure, it would be a crime if he had actually done this with a 14 year old and something had happened when they met up... but the american police have basically created this whole scenario and lead him into it, feeding him along?

this suggests to me that the police officer was the one who suggested everything... coaxed him into it... we don't know the full story but i get the impression that this "14 year old girl" offered him sex on a plate willingly....

would that be legal in this country? i mean i think it's wrong that this guy would meet up with a 14 year old with the intent to have sex... but fabricating the situation... you can't arrest someone for something they haven't done... it's just wrong...

am i the only one who thinks this is messed up?

Not sure if someone's already mentioned this, but a TV programme called "To Catch A Predator" did this - Chris Hansen basically set up stings and then publicly filmed them when he revealed himself to them. Not sure if they lead to arrests, I think they did

I'm baffled at how you can be on his side.

He has the intention of sleeping with a minor, which is not only illegal but immoral.

If the police arrest a man with detailed plans for blowing up a building in a city, with all the equipment for making a bomb, but he hasn't actually made it yet, would you be on this man's side too?

I think not, I think you'd be glad they intervened and took one potential bomber off the streets, much like they've took one potential child rapist of the streets here.

There's a significant difference here - the paedophile caught would have been looking on forums and the like FOR young girls. It's not like the girl turned up on his doorstep, stripped and then they arrested him.

People have their preferences. Many centuries ago, so-called "paedophilia" would not even have been frowned upon. You must know morality is relativity, right? I mean many centuries ago, if you were known for killing ferocious men in foreign lands, you were praised by your people for valiant behaviour, bravery etc.
