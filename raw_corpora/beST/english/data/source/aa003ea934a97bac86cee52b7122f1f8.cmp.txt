A saffron red thread called a tilak, worn around the wrist is considered to have deep religious significance among Hindus, that's the red bit around his right wrist.

So on the one hand since one was wearing a Hindu tilak, it appears certain that the Mumbai attackers were in no way connected to Pakistan at all.

On the other, there are reports that at least some of the attackers had stayed at Nariman House, which is an exclusively Jewish hostel in Mumbai prior, which opens up a whole new can of worms so to speak.

the 3rd pic is of the surviving terrorist in mumbai....i dont think any of the terrorist at mumbai had been used before..due to their inexperience....the main fault was of the police force in lack of response to the situation....
