We hear from Iraq every day - every development is tracked. Iran and Turkey, too, get reported on much, their political turmoil magnified. But what do we know about Syria? What is going on there? Will we be once more surprised when, suddenly, turmoil erupts there, and we dont know what happened or why? There is no reason to assume Syria might not become the next flash-point in the Middle East, whether by American intervention (of whichever kind) or internal revolt - yet it seems such a blank spot...

I myself have never read up on Syria beyond what the newspapers tell me - and they've told me barely anything. Its a gruesome dictatorship - of the kind that was formerly sponsored by the Soviets. A bit of a family autocracy, too. I know about the Golan and about Syrian meddling in the Lebanese civil wars. There's Kurds in Syria, too, I believe. And thats about it - dont know more than that. What about you? Shouldn't we keep track of stuff that goes on there - in, say, a pre-emptive information strike?

Very basic, but I like starting at the CIA site.

Glad you started this one. I was recently thinking I should know more about the Sudan, as well as Syria. I'm re-sparked. <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"/>

Yes. First yours about Georgia, now this one about Syria. We should start a sequence of these threads ;-).

Syria seems to have dropped out of the group of 'newsworthy' Mideast locations since the death of Hafez al-Assad, the father of the present-day president. I know absolutely nothing about this kid who is now in charge. The old man was a strange enigma. He was an Alewite, and -- as the CIA site provided by Sofia indicates -- the Alewites are a miniscule minority in Shi'ia-dominated Syria. It's like having a Presbyterian president in Italy. The Ba'ath party is the dominant force in Syria as it was in Iraq under Saddam Hussein. What's interesting is that Assad and Hussein were sworn enemies in spite of their membership in the same party. Syria backed Iran during the Iraq-Iran war. even though the Syrian republic is quite secular while Iran at the time was ruled by the Ayatollah Khomeini. If that ain't enigmatic, what is? During the Gulf War, Syria allied itself to the American-led forces to defeat Saddam.

I personally believe that Syria wants very much to get on our (USA) good side. They would certainly benefit from trade with the USA and I think the current situation in Iraq has given them a good scare. Interesting that Lybia's Muamar Khadaffi is negotiating to get off our s*it list by renouncing nuclear weaponry. Khadaffi and Assad the Elder were good buddies and allies. I wonder whether Khadaffi's move heralds a new direction in the realtionship between the West and the formerly anti-US Arab nations. Only time will tell.

I was in Damascus in 1986 during the Gulf of Siddra crisis when American warships shelled Lybia. It was touch-and-go for an American walking the streets in Syria at that time. Yet the people stayed friendly enough and everybody smiled at me. I don't know how sizeable the Kurdish population is, but they are very conspicuous, unlike the handful of Jews whom you would have difficulty in finding. My understanding (imperfect, I'm sure) is that there is no active persecution of Jews in the country. But they are not allowed to leave Syria, not even to study abroad. The fear is that any Jew who gets out of Syria to, say, Switzerland or France or the US, will find his/her way to Israel and add one more gun to the army guarding the Golan Heights. There was (is?) a UN peacekeeping force guarding the approaches to the Golan Heights. They were headquatered at a town called Quinetra but the soldiers of the Austrian Army, which had the duty when I was there, all came into Damascus for their R&amp;R. In spite of being largely Muslim, Damascus is not a dry town. Cocktail lounges in all the downtown hotels and the local version of Arrack isn't half bad.
