I share the views of several others in this thread that I wouldn't want the Greens in goverment - but that's not a concern of course. I do, however, want to see a handful of green MPs in Westminster. I would also be glad to see the BNP and UKIP have a few faces there, too.

I really disagree with many green policies and green people. I was deciding between BNP and Green, basically.
If the Greens make a good show for the next election, like this time, I will probably give them my vote again. The BNP only got 1.5% of the vote here.

Now that's my kinda logic. I was disappointed with the Barking and Buckingham results, as well as Plaid and SNP's lack of decent gains... and the lib dems of course.

Overall the establishment won tonight, grr!

Hey, you seem to know you stuff, a libertarian stood in an Ealing seat, do you know how I can find out what share of the votes he got? (Clearly he didn't win, but its still nice to see what happened.)

In a Manchester local seat the libertarian candidate was only about 20 votes from beating the greens, grr!

(And over 2000 from winning.) <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/p.gif" alt=":p:"/>

This is the best news of the election for me, as a supporter of a small party, this shows that it can be done. It's so nice to see a colour on the map there that isn't red/blue/yellow (that isn't snp, plaid or NI.)

<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/election2010/results/constituency/a69.stm">This</a> is the vote share, and swing from labour to greens that allowed this to happen.

What does everyone think of this then? I'm sure people who actually support the greens must be delighted, given that I am and I don't even support their (economic) policies.

Didn't think they'd go down well with a Libertarian <img src="images/smilies/wink.png"/>

But anyway, I'm delighted. Anyone with a brain knows they're not a single issue party at all and it's great to see a left wing party make a break through, especially in this election.

I wanted Nick to win Barking too, I just want to see minor parties breaking through the system.

There would be no need for investment as everything would be tax funded, taxes would raise but so much would be provided by the government spending money becomes less vaulable, I don't really understand what you mean by no 'innovation' and no need for competion (if you mean in terms of aspirations and **** as i think you do) as everybody would have everything they NEED (all be it not all they want).

If everyone has everything they need, why is there any need for innovation? Why would people bother to produce anything on time? Why can people not set up private businesses on their property - why are you making this illegal? You are denying them their basic rights.

It is exactly "aspirations and ****", and the desire to have what you want and not just what you need, that has led to the invention of nearly everything that has improved our lives.

I was so happy they got a seat - a glimmer of hope in an otherwise depressing election. Here's hoping that, should they have another election to fix the hung parliament, they'll still keep her in!
