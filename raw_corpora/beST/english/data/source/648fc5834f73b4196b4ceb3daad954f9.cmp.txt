For the first time since the war began, a majority of the respondents to the Gallup poll  54 percent  say the war in Iraq has not been worth the costs, while 44 percent said it has been worthwhile. When the war first began in March 2003, 29 percent of Americans said the war was not worth it, while 68 percent said it was.

And it seems it's not finished.

A terribly expensive war

(quote) The White House had hoped to hold off asking for more money to fund military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan until after the election, but with costs rising faster than expected, it sent a request for an early installment of $25 billion to Congress this week.

The terse, three-page request came with a catch that stunned lawmakers: While the funds were allocated to broad categories -- $16 billion for the Army, $6 billion for the other services, $5 billion for covert operations -- Bush asked for a free hand to transfer the money to other activities related to Iraq and Afghanistan at will.

Congress should be wary of writing a blank check. It is a risky precedent. Traditionally Congress has jealously guarded its constitutionally bestowed control of the purse strings. Bush said he would transfer the money only for "emergency and essential" purposes. But those are elastic terms, and this request will not be the last.

The Bush administration has said it will come back later in the year for a second installment of $25 billion, for a total of $50 billion. But even that might not be enough. New figures given Congress this week say spending on Iraq and Afghanistan could be $66 billion or more for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.

The nation was assured before the war that Iraqi oil revenues would pay for rebuilding and occupying Iraq; the implication being that this venture would be of only moderate cost to the taxpayers. Iraq's oil revenues are projected at $16.6 billion this year. Once the money is deducted to renovate the oil fields after years of neglect and mismanagement, what's left might not even be enough to fund the new interim Iraqi government. With the $160 billion or so we have spent so far, plus another $66 billion next year, the cost of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan could be more than $220 billion by the end of fiscal 2005.

Wasn't it Larry Lindsey who was fired as White House economic adviser three months in advance of the invasion of Iraq for suggesting that the war would cost between $100 billion and $200 billion?
(end of quote.)

And that's only money.
Then you have the lost of American, Coalition and Iraqi lives.
Next you have all those lives which are damaged with all various type of wounds and life-time handicaps.
Next to that you have all those people coming back or staying there with terrible emotional impressions and memories.

And let's be honest... what's the result... of all these costs?

Thank you for your concern Pelastration. Below is the address where you can send your personal check:

I think it's the least you can do, since the USA has been protecting your postage stamp size country for the last sixty years.

The war was right, despite whether those in power had alternative motives.
The war is costing too much.
I would support spending twice as much if it were NEEDED.
Why aren't the Iraqis being paid 10 bucks a day to rebuild their own country?
I hate bloated spending.
