This is probably going to be a bit of a rambling post...

It's my 29th birthday in a few weeks time and over the past 6 months I have started to fret about turning 30/having to make decisions about the 'big' things in life - houses, marriage, children etc. When I say fret, I mean it is actually giving me nightmares and sometimes I wake up feeling very down. I also feel some resentment towards friends of the same age who seem to be a little further along in their 'life plan' than I am.

The problem is, that I don't really have a life plan but I am the sort of person who likes to have things fairly planned out. At the moment I feel like I am coming to an age where I have to start deciding what I do and do not want to do - and that annoys me! A lot of this revolves around money (or lack of), weddings = money, children = money and houses = money. I earn a good wage at the moment and am studying towards professional accounting qualifications but am also on a DMP until the end of 2012. I just don't see how I can do it all? Maybe the answer is that I can't?

I have been with my partner just under 3 years and we rent together, he is lovely and as supportive as he can be but he just doesn't 'get it'. He is almost 32 but is very laid back and has no plans beyond the end of next week, let alone within the next 5 years. I would love to get married but he hasn't propsed and as far as I know he isn't planning to (I understand it is on the cards at some point but no idea when), I don't know whether I want children or not (he isn't bothered either way) but this is now becoming more important as I am taking medication for a skin complaint and must wait 12 months to start trying after I finish it. I also don't ever see how we can afford children, I am the main earner and only get statutory Mat pay......I know we would love our own house but I can't save anything until the end of my DMP. If we do buy a house then surely that means no children as we'll have a mortgage to pay?! And we can't buy a house AND get married...............urgh, do you see what I mean?

I can't see any logical way to move forward which is probably why it gets me down so much, I think it is also a lack of being in control. I know there is no easy answer and that's not what I am looking for here, maybe I just want to know I am not alone in feeling like this?!

Humour me....please <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/laughing-smiley-014.gif"/>

I think everyone feels like you at sometime in their lives.. if everyone put off getting married/having a family till they could afford it many would be single and childless.. I felt like you when I was 19, no savings, poorly paid job, husband to be was on apprentice wages then I got pregnant shock! horror!... oh my I thought it was the end of the world but it wasn't. We got married on a shoestring, had a baby and made do, the rest is history... you just have to get on with life sometimes and hope for the best and it usually turns out ok...

Hi jtr,

No you're not alone! My situation is only slightly different from yours, in that my partner and I recently married, but we also rent, and I am on a DMP, with a current estimated finish date of September 2015 <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/speechless-smiley-040.gif"/>

If it hadn't have been for my parents giving us a large sum of money for the wedding, we would still be engaged, with no wedding date in sight. We both earn an ok wage, in that we live comfortably, pay our bills and can afford to buy clothes, food etc, but have little at the end of the month to put into savings. We would like to have a honeymoon at some point this year, as we were only able to go away (in the UK) for a couple of days after the wedding, again, due to my parents paying for our break for our wedding present.

We would like to start a family, and think about buying a house, but until we can start saving a decent amount of money each month, it's just not going to happen. I am about to turn 30, so my biological clock is ticking quite loudly! My OH is a bit luckier in that he is only 25 but I know he worries about money and would like to have more of it, to be able to provide for us both.

I think if I really knuckled down and saved and scrimped and lived a very meagre life, I could possibly shave a couple of years off my DMP, so am going to redo my SOA and see if I can increase my payment to Payplan to get things moving a bit quicker.

But I do worry that it is going to take years to dig myself out of this little hole and be able to be in a place where we can comfortably afford a child and think about buying a house!

Good luck <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/smile.gif"/>
