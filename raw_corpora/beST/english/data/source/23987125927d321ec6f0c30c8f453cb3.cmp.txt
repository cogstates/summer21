If you're going to quote me, I'd appreciate it if you didn't alter what I say to suit you. Or at least make it more clear where the alterations begin, and where my actual comments end.

In any case, I assume that you would be angry if a group of people surrounded your car and smashed the windows while shouting threats. I might suggest that you would think it was, "just over the top."

I was correcting your statement as it was the car that got attacked. And honestly im not that fussed. Now be quiet or i'll kick your car!

There wasn't a single part of my post that implied they were responsible for the fees increasing.

They didn't get hit, they got a smashed window and paint on their car.

I know they didn't get hit. You said in your post that you would laugh at Camilla if she got hit.

It's just appeared on the AP wires and the BBC live coverage. People who spilled over from the "protest" attacked their car as it went down Regent Street. No harm done to them, apparently.

Looks like the mob is spilling over.

Maybe they'll act against these stupid Politicians then.

I would much rather the Royal Family in charge than some house of commons bigots anyway.

Harry is a right laugh and would be great as a proper leader for this country, even Prince William.

Leader? <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/confused.gif" alt=":confused:"/> Countries don't need leaders, the leaders of a country are the very people who live there. Leave the masochist ideas for later, please.

Trip to reality for the royals

they're just people born into priviledge.

It's important - a group of protestors overwhelmed the Police Escort. That sort of thing is not supposed to happen.

As for disliking them - you might not, but they're still people. Nobody deserves to be attacked just for being born into the 'wrong' kind of family, be it very poor, or very rich.

They got attacked by being born in that kind of family.
I got my loans risen by being born in that kind of family.
We got beaten. They too. Simple. Life is hard I know.

The point isn't that the attack was minor, it was that it could happen at all. Royal security is supposed to be better.

One day I would get some TSR users and we will beat almost to death all members of the Royal family except the Queen.
Some users who depend on masochism neg me. It feels good. <img src="images/smilies/wink.png"/>

Wouldn't be surprised if the police escort let the students attack them on purpose. Just for lols at camilla getting floored.

Agree with first poster - Royals should have more power. Well, Her Majesty should, anyway.

No problem, let's go backwards. Let's destroy everything elderly British people fought for. They will die soon, who care about what they can think about it? Let's take the monarchy back and cut people's rights. I love your idea,milord.

I enjoyed Boris Johnson's comment about the attack being an insult to democracy, seems a touch ironic when discussing the royals, no?

</quote>

Democracy? With monarchy? wtf? Monarchy by itself erases great part of the meaning of democracy. It's like trying to make fire in the middle of the ocean in water surface.

Are they?

That's funny because I think the majority of the current UK population are under the illusion that we are under the leadership of Cameron &amp; Clegg. Or those 2 seem to think that its only their opinions that matter. <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/mad.gif" alt=":mad:"/>

The UK is not a full democracy and we as the people of the UK never vote on all the main issues. We also hardly ever get listened to on the majority of topics.

They fought for the country (if it was ruled by a King okay, but that was something out of their reach). The King likes being King for the power and nothing else, otherwise he would be begging to be taken his position as soon as possible. Why would someone fight for someone who would not fight for you had the King the chance?
