The problem I have here is that the WBC's site isn't a memorial site for Matthew Snyder, it is their own property to disseminate their point of view. By the time Mr. Snyder did his google search he knew from media sources WBC had been present, but he chose voluntarily to view it anyway.

IIED is a very narrow and hard to win tort for a reason, you don't want to open the door to multi million dollar judgments for anyone who says something that hurts a person's feelings, whether directed at them or not, whether made in their presence or not, whether intent to harm that individual is real or whether it is a promotional piece for their movement and the intent to harm is simply imputed because the offended party went out of his way to find it.

If this were any group other than WBC, would you feel the same way? Think about that, because whatever ruling comes down will affect all religious, quasi-political and groups out there as far as whether they can picket, protest, or use any material on their website or in their publications naming groups or individuals or that could be considered offensive to named groups or individuals.

It's the voluntary and knowing nature of Mr. Snyder's exposure that bugs me. I just don't feel comfortable with expanding IIED that far, WBC assholes or no.

Well said but I trust the jury verdict. They are the voice and interpreters of this tort and did their duty. This is about a family and their grief first and religion, or lack of it as WBC clearly shows, plays no part in it for me.

The only problem with trusting the jury on this one is that they were given a question of law to determine. It was left up to them to decide whether the First Amendment applied. No jury should be deciding questions of law, those are to be decided by the judge prior to giving the case to the jury to determine the questions of fact. So if the jury was in fact instructed incorrectly, chances are they will not come to the correct conclusion. The Jury Instruction given on this clearly put the question of First Amendment protection in their laps.

I still think for this reason alone it will be remanded for a new trial with instructions no matter what the outcome, unless WBC wins outright (probably not) in which case it will be remanded for summary judgment. There wasn't a jury verdict based on the proper findings from the proper source. Nor should the jury be interpreting the nature and scope of the tort - again, that is a question of law. The jury is to be instructed as to the law to be applied to the facts they determine, not the other way around. Determining the law and instructing the jury in that law is what the judge is for.

Respectfully, I have investigated over 1000 cases for trial in 30 years. The jury is charged on the law and in this case material fact was the free speech 1st Amendment protection. That is a jury decision as to the facts:
State v. Howell "The jury must beleft perfectly free in reaching a conclusion upon the testimony introduced, untrammeled by any intimidation from the judge as to whether a certain fact at issue has been proved or not"
Concerning the 1st Amendment Constitutional argument and jury charges by a judge:
Norris v. Clinkscales "A judge violates this provision when he expresses in his charge his own opinion upon the force and effect of the testimony, or any part of it, or intimates his views of the sufficiency or insufficiency of the evidence, in whole or in part.
Under the Constitution the force and effect, or weight and sufficiency, of testimony and facts must be left exclusively to the jury, uninfluenced by any expression or intimation of opinion on The First Amendment or any other Amendment.

I agree with you, Quantum Windbag, and so do most legal commentators I have read. There doesn't seem to be any novel con law question presented on these facts and it's a puzzler why the SCOTUS took the cert.

Have you read the 4th Circuit opinion and the transcript of yesterday's questioning? It seems the Court is looking at whether the 4th Circuit was correct in disregarding the public v. private nature of the individuals and event and focusing on the type of speech instead. There's also a side issue of amicus waivers. Interesting stuff if you haven't looked at it.

The attorney for the church is the daughter of the nut case pastor.
The public v. private nature is THE argument for the church as the ruling in the Jerry Fallwell v. Hustler case is what they are hanging their entire argument on.
How they can claim the father of the soldier is a public figure is absurd. That is the entire case. The father IS NOT a public figure and is a private citizen.
The jury verdict must stand.
