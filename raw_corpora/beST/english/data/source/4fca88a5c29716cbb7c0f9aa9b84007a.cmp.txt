OK...then you can relate....

One of my clients was hit with a new local ordnance regarding loading bay width.

Apprarently, some worker at some other company did not follow loading bay rules and tried to walk around the far side of a truck that had little clearance from the wall to the side mirror....he nerly took his entire nose off....for the truck mirror was damaged and sharp.

So the local legislator pushed for a new regulation adding 6 inches to the width of a loading bay.....and it was instituted.

My client had 12 months to comply wioth the new regulation.....and as you know.....it is pretty expensive to have to widen a loading bay.....

He did it at a cost of over 75K.....during a year where his profits barely allowed him his basic s-corp salary of 1K per week...and NO distributions...so he was forced toactually spend an extra 75K in a year where he took home only 52K...

Ya think he wanted to hire new people?

Local ordinances have nothing to do with Obama.

If he was renting he could have relocated and avoided the whole thing.

I didnt say it had anything to do with Obama.
I was talking about how regulations have an adverse affect on cpompanies desire to grow.

He owned.

If he had rented he was beholden to a legal contract known as a lease....and he could not have simply moved...and it wopuldnt have been his responsibility to expand the loading bay...such would be the responsibility of the property owner per conditions in the lease.

I am confused...you are an employer who just gave 10% raises to all of your employees...but you are not aware of the legal obligations of a lease and who would be responsible for the adherence to local ordanances?

How is that possible? Whether you own or lease, ANY business owner with a warehouse would know who is repsponsible for what as it pertains to physical property legally required alterations.

If he had twelve months to do it and he was leasing he could have easily relocated.

Starting a business has some risks....you can eliminate most of them with a sound business plan....but you can not control things like weather, natural disasters, and other factors that may affect you at the most critical time...your first year.

But even if you have a sound business plan...and one that allows for the survival of a slow time.....a business owner can not predict what congress and the President may decide...

Thus why we (bunsiness owners) get really pissed off at inititaitves that are brought up in congress and addressed for years...for it doesnt allow us to forecast properly..

Like cap and trade. Will it happen? Who knows. Can it? Hell yeah...there is already an exchange ready to go to handle it...Will it affect cmpanies? Heck...hundreds iof not thousands will go under within a year....

So as a result....many are assuming it will go through and thus are amassing as much capital as possible now to use to buy its carbon shares when it passes......and all at the expense of growing now.

And if it doesnt pass?

Then they wilkl grow when word comes out that it will not pass...

Until then?

Wait, see and hoard cash.

But you said your clients were loosening up and starting to hire again. That means the economical outlook is good?

Unemployment rates are a lagging economic indicator. If your clients are starting to hire again, that means recovery has been happening for a number of months now.

It is slowly recovering on its own despite Obamas policies and business crunching regulations. I am very glad it is coming around but I just wish we could vote Obama out now to expedite the process.

My prediction is that if Obama loses the election growth will double the current snails pace its growing at. In fact I bet upon the news alone that he loses the election we will start seeing firms hire and invest exponentially.

...the number of layoffs nationwide caused by government regulation is minuscule and shows no evidence of getting worse during the Obama administration. Lack of demand for business products and services is vastly more important.

So sueing companies like Boeing because they want to build in a state his "friends" don't control is not hurting job growth? Or regulating farm dust or putting light bulb companies out of business or stopping oil drilling for so long all the platforms went to other countries instead of waiting or any other numerous stupid decision he has made.

how about the forced closing of all those automobile dealerships. He actually stole people's livelihood..

Democrats took over after 2006. And yes they did a mighty fine job driving us into the ditch.

If Bush/Cheney were doing such outstanding employment numbers where did those jobs go?

Was it a repeat performance of RINO REPUB bank fraud under Bush/Cheney that wrecked the economy then the job market?

I thought congress was responsible like you guys claim they are now? Make up your minds.
