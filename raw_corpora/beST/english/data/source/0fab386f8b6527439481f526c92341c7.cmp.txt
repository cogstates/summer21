But the fact he agreed shows he has it within him to do that. Just because a '14 year old girl' offers sex is every man going to accept that, no. One less paedophile on the streets.

but is a guy who's willing to have sex with a 14 year old girl therefore definitely a paedophile though? in many countries that'd be completely legal

it's short but if you don't want to read it basically a guy in the USA has been arrested for agreeing to meet up with and have sex with a "14 year old girl" who was actually an undercover cop...

surely this is entrapment? he didn't actually do anything because they basically lead him into the situation? sure, it would be a crime if he had actually done this with a 14 year old and something had happened when they met up... but the american police have basically created this whole scenario and lead him into it, feeding him along?

this suggests to me that the police officer was the one who suggested everything... coaxed him into it... we don't know the full story but i get the impression that this "14 year old girl" offered him sex on a plate willingly....

would that be legal in this country? i mean i think it's wrong that this guy would meet up with a 14 year old with the intent to have sex... but fabricating the situation... you can't arrest someone for something they haven't done... it's just wrong...

am i the only one who thinks this is messed up?

I think this is more widely allowed and used in the USA than here. I suppose if they wanted to have a really good case against him, they would have to be extremely passive and let him do most of the work. Personally I don't see anything wrong with it - he was gonna do it. They may have just prevented a child from being raped

I'm not sure its entrapment really.

Entrapment is where the person has no other choice than to comply. Eg busting an undercover cop for buying drugs or a civilian for buying drugs under threats of violence.

Why are people defending him?! The fact that he even agreed is sooo messed up! So maybe the punishment is harsh because he didn't really 'do' anything, but still, even the thought of chatting to her is wrong! Stop cutting him slack.

Because it's been established that this form of attraction, is in fact quite normal in some cases and not necessarily perverted. - they should have chosen a much younger police officer, Doogie Howsers younger sister perhaps.

We are not necessarily defending this particular individual - just saying it's possible for there to be a very normal attraction between a man and some young girls - if she reciprocates then it should be between them. Unfortunately for better or worse some humans have grown so smart they are able to find fault with normal programming and improve on nature.

If instead of age we used cup and frontal cortex size it might be fairer system.

no that's not true, there does not have to be threats etc. nor does the defendant have to have no other choice...
