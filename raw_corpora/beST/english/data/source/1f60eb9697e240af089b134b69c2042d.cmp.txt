I liked that video about the Building #13 store somebody posted earlier. But I have to ask.. isn't there something in the US regulating stuff like this, especially when it comes to food? In that video the guy showed rusty cans of food, eating the contents could probably make you very seriously ill. A store like this wouldn't survive in my country, as it would get closed down by state inspectors. Doesn't something like this exist in the US? I remember a supermarket in my area having to close down for a few weeks, their only crime was having freezers not quite up to spec. EDIT: Oh also, as an amusing side note, we had walmart here for a while but they completely tanked, gave up, and sold their stores to local chains. I went into a walmart here once and it was pretty much the most confusing experience I ever had.

In the US food manufacturing and preparation is regulated but food retailing is not. So, any store that prepares food on-site for sale (like a grocery store with a bakery, deli, or meat counter) would be inspected by the local health department but stores that stock only pre-packaged foods are unregulated.

Too bad the same cannot be said for Dennis Miller.

Okay, is it just me, or is there an epidemic lately on these forums of people going on about how things are where they live, but never actually mentioning where the hell it is that they live? Am I missing something here? Is a poster's location listed somewhere obvious and I'm just missing it?

I'm sorry to call you out in particular as you are only one of many, many people who do this lately, but goddamn is it annoying to me. Am I alone here?

I do inventory and ordering at a Kmart. I can tell you right off that we have a Dragonball Z VHS tape ($20), a Lizzie Maguire GBA game ($15) (plus several other Disney/Nickelodeon GBA games), a pack of Rugrats UNO cards. I'll see if I can find anymore weird stuff and take pictures of it.

Also a package of Hanes boxers that has been there since 2000 (assuming it's been there since the date written on it). Still rings up $12 and it's yellowed now. Dead Pikachu fucked around with this message at Mar 04, 2012 around 03:48

The local Rite Aid has had a giant 128mb flash drive behind the photo counter marked at $49 for at least 5 years now.

Working at a Wal-Mart in the NEO region I can tell you Corporate has basically given up on that store as well as the [url=http://www.walmart.com/storeLocator/ca_storefinder_details_short.do?rx_dest=%2Findex.gsp&amp;rx_title=com.wm. <a href="http://www.apps.storelocator.page.servicelink.title.default">http://www.apps.storelocator.page.s...k.title.default</a> ]Bedford Walmart[/url]. We won't send employees there even if they ask. We also warn all customers away from it...as politely as possible.

Favorite story from the Bedford one is we had someone go over there to try to get their electronics department up to shape. It was so bad the person we sent over walked over to the camera case took all the cameras out of the unlocked case (its never supposed to be unlocked) and put them in a box behind the photo counter and waited
...and waited
...and two hours later someone noticed.

That store is a loving cesspool.

Work downtown. I was bored one day so I figured I would head down to stealyard at lunch and see what new Star wars items were in stock. Bought a few thing, the scalpers clear the rack here(Avon) every Tuesday morning. So anyways I was pretty pleased with my finds until that 350 pound lady felt the need to practically strip search me before I could leave, with armed guard behind her. Haven't been back, lower taxes out here anyways.

Since we seem to have a couple locals reading this thread. Head over to B.A. Sweeties on Brookpark rd. for your racist candy fix. Serious if you like candy and haven't been there.

It's almost as if our country (the United States) is way behind the rest of the civilized world or something.
