It is quite shocking that u 'd think that America
wanted to inflict the horrors of the French Revolution on the English.

We were innocent of that.

Alright David perhaps I am being a bit too extreme.
</quote>
Being extreme is OK if u r ACCURATE, in bearing close fidelity
to what actually HAPPENED.
Your accusation against us is purely imaginary,
with no trace of a basis in fact.

<quote orig_author="izzythepush">
It's all a question of where you're sitting.
</quote>
Its NOT; its a question of being factually ACCURATE in your assertions.

<quote orig_author="izzythepush">
I don't honestly believe that the ordinary American in 1812 wanted to do such a thing.

I never heard of extraordinary Americans desiring that the French Apocalypse fall on England.
We were at peace since 1783.

U know that William had good and logical claims on the throne, by heredity.

During the Napoleonic Wars Britain, (not just England, it was after the Act of Union) faced one of the biggest threats of invasion ever.
We had witnessed what the revolutionaries had done to their own people. What would they have done to the old enemy?

I see; u had Napoleon in mind.

<quote orig_author="izzythepush">
I get a bit fed up with all the Brit bashing whenever the Revolution is mentioned.
You seem to hold the founding fathers as some sort of group of Saints, which is fine.
</quote>
AGREED!

<quote orig_author="izzythepush">
You then expect everyone else to blindly accept that.

NO; thay were good for US, not for u.

We also have to take the part of the black hearted villain with good grace.
George III is vilified as some sort of Geogian Nero, but in terms of monarchs he wasn't that bad.
</quote>
He was a big admirer of George Washington.

<quote orig_author="izzythepush">
He was very interested in modern agriculture, was concerned about the common man and lived a rather modest lifestyle, for a monarch.
Compare him with his son to see a figure more befitting of the title Nero.

Your founding fathers were not wholly altruistic Saints.
</quote>
America stands for personal freedom &amp; Individualism, not for altruism.

<quote orig_author="izzythepush">
A lot of them did very well out of the Revolution.
</quote>
GOOD THING!!!

<quote orig_author="izzythepush">
George Washington became the first American millionaire. I'm not saying the American Revolution wasn't a bad thing.
America is by and large a wonderful country, but it was founded by men with their own vices, not saints.

I also don't think that I should get down on my knees and thank every American for their wartime contribution.
</quote>
Will u not be kneeling qua the First World War, or the Second World War??

<quote orig_author="izzythepush">
Britain and Russia could not have won the war alone, but to hear some Americans talk you'd think America did it all single handed. Not only that but we get Hollywood blockbusters telling blatant lies. Band of Brothers, and more recently the Pacific were two wonderful wartime series which acurately showed the wartime experience and contribution of American troops. Not to mention the outstanding bravery.

It grieves me that Ike acquiesced so much to Monty.
Bad news.

Ike was too much of a diplomat and not enuf of a soldier.

Other films are not nearly so truthful.
I'm not talking about films like Inglorious Basturds, which everyone knows is a load of nonsense, but films like U-571 which portrays itself as being historically accurate, but is a complete lie.
1) U boat crew are presented as evil murdering Nazis, whereas most of them were quite decent. I don't think any U boat crew were prosecuted for war crimes.
2) An American ship captures the enigma machine. The Enigma machine was captured by HMS Bulldog before America entered the war. Not only that the enigma codebreaking operation was an almost entirely British affair, run from Bletchley Park. Most analysts say it shortened the war by about 2 years, but we don't go on about that. (I know I did go on about it then but it's just once).

Having said that, I'm sorry if I've offended you and Setanta. I do think America is a wonderful country with lots of lovely people. Nuff said.

@Thomas,

And not to forget the Scottish-Irish colonists.
Leaving out Spanish and French colonists in what is now the USA seems to be quite common...

@izzythepush,

<quote orig_author="izzythepush">
Alright, Chesapeake Bay incident happened during the Napoleonic wars.
America wasn't really neutral, it was a major ally of the enemy. Things happen in wartime.

Pressganging was something else that happened during war.
It ended in 1814.

That 's a good thing! U better not try it NOW.

Our troops were fighting Napoleon in Spain and Portugal. Maybe our interpretation of history does not reflect the American view. Then again you all seem to be more concerned with patting yourselves on the back than anything else.

Izzie gets the A2k award for projection for this one !!

America is not under threat of invasion from Iran. That does not mean that the US Navy would not stop a North Korean cargo ship en route to Iran. Is that hubris as well?
</quote>

America in 1812 was not a threat to the British Empire, while nuclear armed North Korea is today a threat to both the USA and the UK.

The religious-persecution story is overhyped by pious schoolbook editors.
</quote>

This can't be emphasized too much. It's also a part of the "New England-centric" American mythic history.

@izzythepush,

What the hell qualifies as a "major ally" for you? There were no American ships supporting the Franco-Spanish fleets, there were no American troops fighting with Napoleon, American merchants weren't shipping war materials to France. Your paranoia is truly amazing--and completely unjustified.
