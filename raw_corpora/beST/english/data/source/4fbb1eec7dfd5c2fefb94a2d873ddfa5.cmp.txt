I apologise in advance if there is something similar to this thread, but this is a topic that has interested me recently and would just like to hear your views on the matter.
I'm a British Pakistani, born and brought up in London, however I would say I am very much in touch with my roots and my views lean more towards the traditional and conservative side. Recently I watched a documentary by Saira Khan 'Don't tell my Mother I am in Pakistan', made a few years ago, yet a very interesting watch. I have been on holiday to Pakistan a fair amount of times, and have traveled throughout the country, so I thought I had a pretty accurate idea of the country as a whole and it's people. However, after watching the documentary and various other programs and films on Pakistan I am absolutely shocked. I may be wrong when I say this, but was Pakistan not founded as a Muslim state, yet only 64 years on and I don't think the country matches the vision it was initially created with. It seems that the higher class are obsessed with imitating and adopting western culture, in a sense it boosts their superiority complex. I actually find it shocking, that most families who moved to England in the 60's like my grandfather have managed to maintain that cultural pride and certain traditions that have been lost among certain groups of people in Pakistan. Drinking is a common practice with the upper class society and personally I find it quite upsetting, it seems as if Pakistan is moving in the opposite direction- the rich becoming more obsessed with western culture and the less well off being neglected further. Also whilst I'm on this topic, has anyone seen the film 'Slackistan' and what were your views?
Thank for reading my thoughts! <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

Once these dictators get overthrown, who only raise their voices once their precious soldiers get killed (not when their civilians are dying in the thousands), then maybe, Pakistan can return to its vision.

Why are you living here ?

Oh yeah because Pakistan is a poverty stricken, third world, failed state.... silly me.

Yet, it wasn't too long when your own nation was burning people on the stake because they don't float on water.

Power changes, don't be foolish enough to think it won't change again.

Let's make this nice and easy for you. All of the castes are.....that's right, Hindu. So despite caste divisions, they have a vast majority, and are likely to follow a HIndu agenda over a Muslim one. Stop arguing this non-point. <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/facepalm.gif" alt=":facepalm:"/>

Oh my gosh, this is like talking to a brick wall. The Hindus had a huge majority. Therefor anything which favours the Hindus will have a majority, therefor to the Muslims, a democratic majority means nothing <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/facepalm.gif" alt=":facepalm:"/>

Let us assume a country is 90% Nazi and 10% Jew, would you just wave through any law or legislation based on the fact it's a democratic majority? Now, don't be silly here, I am not equating Muslims or Hindus to Nazis, merely making an analogy.

Next pathetic e.g. of Nazi, pathetic <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:"/> democratic will of people was against great evil of partition and thats a facts, proportional representation was given and thats a fact! yes deny democracy when representation was there!!
Talking of nazism, and fascim the 2 nation theory is exactly that hence ethnic cleansing campaigns began in Pakistan area, and later spread:

J. A. Scott, Deputy Inspector-General of Police in the Rawalpindi range, in a statement to the Press, declared:

“It is unbelievable that barbarous acts such as were committed on innocent people in rural areas of the Rawalpindi Division could be possible in the Punjab.”

All these atrocities on Hindus and Sikhs brought no condemnation whatever from the Muslim League leaders. They either kept silent about them, or continued to trot out imaginary atrocities on Muslims. This not only encouraged the Muslim goondas, but gave them the confidence that they could go on safely with the blessings of the League leaders.
