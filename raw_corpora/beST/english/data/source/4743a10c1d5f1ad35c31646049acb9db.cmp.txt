Repeating a question before answering it is thought to be an indicator of deception, according to this:

<a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/neuronarrative/201106/how-we-know-youre-lying">http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/...ow-youre-lying</a>

I have encountered this notion before. I know it's a delaying tactic, but I would think even an honest person might use it, if they know the answer isn't exactly going to make them or the situation look good. If they need time to make sure they answer with the truth, but in a way that won't be misperceived. It could go either way, I suppose, and it's probably more important to also be looking for the other indicators in that list, as well. One marker does not a liar necessarily make.

Of course, he is lying. <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/wink.gif"/>

slingblade,

Thanks for the link. The author wrote, "How hard is it to catch liars? Very, according to Geiselman and Dr. Paul Ekman, another researcher who has devoted his career to identifying the signs of deception. In previous studies, Ekman found that without training, the average person's abilty to identify a liar is roughly the same as chance."

Skeptical Greg,

The Knox/Sollecito case is a helpful reminder of the benefits of ignoring the chaff that is put out right after an arrest. I can understand why people would have thought Knox and Sollecito guilty if they listened to the statements made by police and prosecutors, many of which were false. Ditto with respect to the three defendants in the Duke lacrosse case.

Innocent until proven guilty is not just a good idea; it's the law. Yet this standard doesn't mean much if the jurors have already made up their minds. Nor does it serve any purpose for the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/13/usa-crime-coach-governor-idUSN1E7AC05920111113">Governor of Pennsylvania</a> to weigh in on McQueary's moral obligations, although at least he has not been indicted (in which case the Governor should keep completely quiet). You are correct that innocent until proven guilty would still apply even if we had a video tape of the alleged rape in the DL case or the sexual assault/murder in the Knox/Sollecito case. Fortunately the alleged acts in each of these two cases flew in the face of the laws of physics and physiology. MOO.

Not when the man publicly states he enjoys horsing around with young boys in the shower. There's not a glimmer of a resemblance to sex killer Knox or liar what's-her-face at Duke.

Why do you suppose the Gov went on public record? He's one of the trustees who is absolutely responsible for the mess at Penn State. He gets to cover his ass (probably a well-advised move here) while placing all the responsibility on the Penn State administration.

By Sandusky's own admission, this stuff has been going on for years although he 'defends' himself by downplaying the blatant sexual assault aspect of his behaviour.

I don't know if Paterno and Sandusky were close at one point but I get the impression that by the time Sandusky left Penn State they were on the outs. Sandusky had the 1998 incident and according to the GJ report not too long after that one of the victims said Paterno told him he wouldn't be the next head coach of PSU and Sandusky was upset about it. And then one year later he retired.

I've read that at Sandusky's retirement party Paterno made only a brief appearance and said only a few words whereas if they were close at that point you'd think Paterno would do and say a lot more at Sandusky's going away party.

I don't know if Paterno ever said anything to Sandusky about his behavior but he must have known at least about the 1998 incident (before 2002 happened I mean) and maybe that's what turned him cold to Sandusky, or maybe he was cold to him already.

I read an column the other day about a guy that was an assistant coach at PSU in the 1980s and a victim of sexual abuse himself as a child and it was fairly scathing of PSU. But anyway, the reason I bring it up is that he said that Sandusky used to tell him that he hated Paterno. So who knows? Maybe it was a case of guys that didn't get along personally but who tolerated each other professionally because doing so helped the football program.

The potential cover-up is as bad as the original series of crimes IMO. That shouldn't just be swept under the rug while all the focus is on Sandusky and his behaviour. I hope they have the equivalent of a Royal Commission to investigate just how far the information traveled about Sandusky. It would also help to examine other programmes and root out this problem once and for all. If Sandusky were the only athletic official to have ever faced such charges then I might not be so concerned but read up on the Theoren Fleury situation in hockey.

This isn't isolated; it's endemic.

Well, in this instance, it isn't very difficult for the average person to come to the conclusion that Sandusky is lying through his lying teeth.

It doesn't even make any sense. He says he stopped it...so where's the kid?

</quote>
Well no, he didn't say he stopped it; he said he "made sure it stopped" which is much more unspecific and sounds like he's setting up some kind of plausible deniability.
