Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has wasted no time in trying to walk back the rhetoric used in the closing days of his ultimately successful re-election campaign. Tellingly, he chose to do so in the American media, telling NBC’s Andrea Mitchellthat America has no greater ally than Israel and Israel has no greater ally than the United States.”

This comes after a campaign that included a commercial arguing that Israel wouldn’t exist if it always listened to America, an allegation that U.S. money was driving high Arab turnout, and, of course, a speech to the U.S. Congress that infuriated the Obama administration and many Democrats. President Obama has not yet called to congratulate Netanyahu on his victory, and White House officials say Netanyahu’s campaign comments, which included a disavowal of Palestinian statehood, could lead to a “reassessment” of the U.S.-Israeli relationship.

But Bibi! You really showed your true colors this election! You were shown to be a liar, a war hawk, a bigot, against a two state solution, and a clear hack! All while many on the far right raged! He really played to his base! But now, he wants to come play nice? &lt;img src="http://www.debatepolitics.com/images/smilies/lmfao.gif" border="0" alt="" title="Laughing my ass off" class="inlineimg"&gt;

Blah blah. Again. 

What he is saying now is entirely consistent with what he said before. 

And he was right before. And you are still wrong.

Bibi said America has no greater ally than Israel. Israel is a staunch ally of the US but that comment alone just shows Bibi's arrogance and ignorance of other Countries relationship with the US. 

My Country remains the only country to have served loyally alongside the United States in every major conflict since WWII. Netanyahu needs to get over himself. His Country is no more a greater Ally to the US than mine has ever been.
