Thanks for picking me, ALB. I'll try not to let down the side.

What I actually said, both times, was that I would get that child out of that place. The order of events and their priority are really important, you see. The child's safety is my prime objective. I mention violence to the perpetrator as a secondary possibility that I'd take on only if necessary to secure my primary objective. If I could get the child out of there without touching the perp in any way, I'd certainly rather do that.

I didn't mean to misquote you, I apologize.

How do I know I'd react this way? I've two reasons:

1. Having survived serial sexual abuse, I know first-hand what that child's experiencing (as I rather expect a certain number of the rest of us might be able to say, true?) And my first instinct today would be to immediately secure that child's safety. From a purely personal point of view that not everyone can share with me, I do know my instincts.

2. I know I'd do it, because I've done it before.

What other people's reasons are for saying the same thing I've said, I couldn't tell you. I know only what I would do, I know exactly why I'd do it, and I know I'm certain of it.

In that case, you most certainly do know what you would do, and I'm deeply and truly sorry you experienced such an awful thing firsthand.

<quote>
So what's the argument here? That I'm wrong to state absolutely that I know I would have reacted differently? Because I've re-read my two initial posts on the subject, and nowhere in there did I talk about anyone's reactions but my own. Now I realizes this means I'm also criticizing McQueary's actions by implication. So are you. So is everyone else. No one here is excusing him.

The problem seems to be only that a few of us are claiming to know what we'd do in the same circumstances.

Why this is a problem for anyone, I cannot fathom, any more than I can fathom simply walking away and leaving that child to be raped.

I won't be discussing it any further. I see no point to it. My own point was simply to express my utter incredulity that anyone, ANYONE, could simply walk away from a child being anally raped, right before his eyes. I've expressed that. If anyone else has anything to say about it, fap away.

I don't have a problem with you saying that, and I don't think you're wrong. I am sorry it seemed that way. I think that since this is such an emotionally-charged topic, in particular for someone who went through sexual abuse, that it is easy for things to be misconstrued.

I find it difficult to imagine anyone, in particular myself, responding the way MacQueary did. I don't feel a need to continue that particular line of discussion, myself, as I don't really see it going anywhere productive and I don't want to drive away intelligent participants from the conversation. I sincerely apologize if it seemed as if I were criticizing you or saying you were wrong, as nothing could be farther from the truth.

It's fine, really. I'm not angry, especially not with you, and I would really hate it if you came away from this thinking I were angry. I assure you sincerely, that isn't the case at all. Your points are well-taken. But I could counter them, and did, and that's all. No harm, buddy, and surely no foul, to use a likely inappropriate sport metaphor. <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

Right - a false dichotomy I was responding to in posts in this thread. In essence, McQueary goes all Braveheart on Sandusky or he's a complicit monster.

It seems to me that a 3rd option of "he should have at least called the police" is also being advocated here.

<quote>
Thus, how's about we put off the "string him up" talk until we know what the heck we're dealing with?

</quote>
Some of us don't want to wait years or decades to have a discussion on "current" events. Waiting until we know what really happened usually requires, at a minimum, that the investigations, trials, and appeals be concluded. And usually, even then, we won't know the full story.

It's OK to form opinions and discuss them in the meantime. I trust most of this people on this site to modify their opinions accordingly as new information comes in.
