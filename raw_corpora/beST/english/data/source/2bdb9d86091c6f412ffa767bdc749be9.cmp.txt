My 10yo son (yr 5) has just been identified as being G &amp; T in science and music.
Now Science I can understand, his favourite programmes are Brainiac, Air Crash Investigation, Prototype this, Scrapheap challenge. He amazes us with scientific facts and figures. He creates k'nex models out of his head (not what's on the box) that can move and wind things up. He's been selected for the 2nd year running to go to a 'workshop' day at the local secondary school which specialises in science.

But Music I'm lost. He plays the violin The school he is at is very musical, they have won awards and play in music festivals. My son is never ever selected to go. He only got in to violin lessons by accident. the school has #try-outs' to see if you are selected when they are going to start introducing another instrument and DS was told by another child he'd got thru to violin lessons when he hadn't and the teacher only spotted the mistake weeks later so let him stay. DS rarely ever practices his instrument and when I do hear him play there's plenty of screeching. He's been having violin lessons at school for the past year.

During another discussion on MSE I was told that the G &amp; T register is the top x% for their school, so in another school where children were better than science than my DS would mean he wouldn't be on the G &amp; T register for it and vice versa. I'd think this must be what has happened with DS and music if the school wasn't so good at music themselves iyswim. My husband went to the parents evening where DS's teacher told him and said that DS had had an assessment and it was to do with the way he held his violin. DS said they were played a tune on the piano and had to him it back.

I am not the slightest bit musical myself and I admit to being flummoxed.

and just in case this thread gets moved to DT, I'm asking in here not only because I know a lot of teachers go on this board but because I need to know if it is true do I need to spend money on more lesons. <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/wink.gif"/> <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/tongue.gif"/>

does your child enjoy playing the violin? only reason i ask is, i played saxophone at school and enjoyed playing it until i got to the age of it not being cool having lessons instead of being with friends, and i often used to miss my lessons, which for some time my parents were unaware of yet still payed for. Good on your son for being gifted in both subjects, but make sure its what he wants to persue otherwise it could get very pricey.

AFAIK he enjoys it. At his school all year 5 children play but because he started lessons in yr 4 he has an additional lesson (eg a school lesson, plus a separate one). When I asked him why he likes the violin he said it's because he likes classical music. I'm just flummoxed as to why he is on a G &amp; T register for music when I hear evidence otherwise (on the rare occassions he practices at home). <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/laughing-smiley-014.gif"/>

Musical means not necessarily good at playing the instrument but its more that he has a natural sense of rhythm and timing.
He has a good ear and can pitch a note. he will know in a sequence if the next note played was higher /lower than the previous.
its an inate talent and something that many people struggle to learn, for him its natural!
It means that he has musical potential (not nec. on violin) not that he is a great player/ singer/ whatever at present.
It may be the violin is no the instrument for him but he should be able to get many years of pleasure from music if he finds the opportunity/ encouragement.
good luck!

Violins are an evil instrument to learn, and you have my sympathy...

I wouldn't pay for extra lessons unless HE wants them and is prepared to practise!

DS3 was on the register for English, which flummoxed me, because I didn't think he'd ever written enough to show any ability...

im not a teacher but maybe they have seen some natural talent in him (talent that is easily hidden from you when all you hear is a screechy violin! lol)

my DD is doing a forensic science course today for a select group of our areas G&amp;T children and believe me a letter arriving from the schools "co-ordinator for more able children" was more than a shock!
