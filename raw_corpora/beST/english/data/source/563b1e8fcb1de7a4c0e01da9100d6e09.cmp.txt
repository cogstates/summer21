I was talking to a friend of mine from Norway, he commented on the differences between US and Norwegian justice system. They have no death penalty, no life sentence, and maximum sentence for a crime is 21 years. He assured me, however, the longest served sentences are around 14 years, its fairly uncommon to serve the full 21.

Now, my perspective as an American is something along the lines of "What the hell? Shorter sentences, safer streets?" I'd never thought it could work. I was wrong.

According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate">this chart</a>, Norway has 0.60 intentional homicides per 10,000, compared to 4.8 per 10,000 in the US. <a href="http://internationalbusiness.wikia.com/wiki/Norway's_Legal_System_Affects_the_Crime_Rate">This page</a> indicates that 60 out of 10,000 Norwegians are incarcerated, compared to 420 out of 10,000 Americans, and at least half of criminal offenses are traffic related. For truly violent criminals, their sentences can be extended 5 years if they are perceived as a public threat; in theory, a person could serve a life sentence in 5 year increments.

To the best of my knowledge, Norway is a considerably more progressive country than the US, much much safer for citizens in many respects. They have a very different take on prison than we do, such as a strong belief that punishing criminals too hard for crimes only serves to create a cycle of violence. They also seem to understand that releasing prisoners with absolutely no support (no job, no place to life, no family, no education, no nothing) forces them to fall back on petty crimes or gang life, quickly going back to prison like its a "revolving door" system.

I think there are numerous instances where our justice system is simply too punitive. I think there are a number of high-profile crimes where criminals are held long long after the point where they are a danger to anyone.

To use the most extreme example, take Leslie Van Houten, a woman involved in the Manson Family murders of the Tate and LaBianca families; Van Houten is a 62 year old woman, extremely fragile, she's made 16 unsuccessful pleas for parole over the past 40 years. She appears to have long deconverted from the Manson cult, she's obviously no public danger to anyone, yet her requests for parole are denied due to the extreme cruelty of her crimes. This, to me, seems beyond pointless, crossing over into the territory of extreme human rights abuse, there's no public good in keeping her incarcerated.

There are many examples of less serious offenders being punished far beyond the point where it would do any good for anyone. I think its an American phenomenon where there's little taboo on being "too hard on criminals", and anything less is perceived as "soft on crime".

Life sentences, even sentences over 20 years are far too much, the deterrent effects aren't there, rehabilitative intent is basically a joke. I think there's something to be said about the Norwegian model.

Correlation is not causation.

While I'm all for prison reform, and have no real beef with your description of the American system, comparing Norway's system and crimes with ours is a nonstarter.
