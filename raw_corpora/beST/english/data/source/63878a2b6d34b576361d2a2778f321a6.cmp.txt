tell that to Rick Santorum

I thought it was Obama that started the contraception thing.

</quote>

It was. It was Santorum that let Obama off the hook by being stupid enough to give the liberal media plenty of sound bytes that enabled them to shift the focus from Obama's dumb fuck position on contraception to Santorum's dumb fuck position on contraception.

i find it much more interesting that the religious right pushes for abortion to become illegal, because life is sacred, while at the same time opposing universal health care.

its extremely hypocritical to say life is sacred when your willing to fight to protect an unborn life, but not willing to fight to protect people who have already been born.

when you force women to have children they may not want, in many cases they become dependent on the state for services such as medicaid, food stamp, welfare, the foster system, etc etc.

They aren't pro life... they're pro birth.

if they weren't, they'd be arranging adoptions for unwanted children.

if they weren't, they'd be supporting day care and job training and education for unwed mothers

if they weren't, they'd support WIC and head start.

but they are....

because it isn't about "life", it's about punishing the harlots and making women incubators.

which is why something like 80% of anti-choice activists are men.

</quote>

The Catholic Church is hugely involved in adoption services. It also funds programs such as day care for single parents (of either gender)..... we also provide school places, for kids from all faiths, and no faith.... Don't let the facts get in the way, though.

</quote>

I have given to Boys Town for many years and I am not even Catholic. I guess there are dozens of programs for girls, and I felt the boys need a leg up as well.

Perhaps the solution to this biological problem, that has become political, is for the Church and Republican party to finance some type of creation or solution that when added to our drinking water removed the sex drive. I remember in the Fifties conservatives did not want flouride added to the water because flouride turned people into communists. If they can create a flouride that makes people communists surely they can come up with some kind of drug that destroys the sex thing.

What about that claim about a communist plot?

Fluoridation was required in East Germany as long as the communists were in charge. When the German Democratic Republic disappeared and the country was reunified in 1990, fluoridation stopped. It is prohibited in Germany now.

The claim is no longer made because it seems so... 1950s. But it wasnÂ’t far off

Today we regard such practices as barbaric. We prefer a nice sterile hospital room to leave babies to cry themselves to death alone.

</quote>

Sure...cause you know....so many kids are born in sterile hospital rooms and then everyone just leaves them alone and lets them die. That happens SO OFTEN. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

If someone has a moral objection to contraception, women are going to be the victims of domestic violence as if no woman that has ever used contraception has been the victim of a abusive partner.

For example, it's okay for you to impose your value, because you are special? In your own mind, maybe, outside of it, the word may take on a different meaning.

</quote>

Neither government nor people should impose their values on anyone.

Idea Censorship is offensive to some, might want to consider the effects of what you advocate.

</quote>

Ideas are fine. I am all for ideas. But when they are of a moral or religious nature it's not government's business. If you want to change society's morals you appeal to the hearts and minds of the people that are willing to listen and if they embrace it what you find to be immoral will eventually die out on it's own. Government forcing a moral or religious principle creates rebellion and in the end delays or prevents it being embraced by society. History is pretty clear on this one.

</quote>

Actually it is not. Maybe in the past, arguably. Yet, Today we fight over everything from the definition of Marriage to when does Human Life start. You might want to consider the distinction between Principle, and Dogma. Principle has every place in a civilized Society, through Culture, and Law. Dogma, has none.
