Truman based his decision on the actions of the Japanese at okinawa, Iwo, and Tarawa. Civilian casualties were respectively 60%, 95% and 90%. US casualties, while lower than Japanese casualties, were severe and the battles protracted. Iwo is a very small rock, but it took two months to clear.

They were budgeting 2 US deaths per square mile.

I have no problem with using the bomb to end it.

The original target was Germany because there was good reason to believe the Germans would come up with the bomb if we didn't. (The were too pig headed and blinded by ideology to do so, lucky for us) It was in Germany that the first big breakthroughs came.

I think the Manhatten project was a waste of resources. They should have spent the resources more wisely. but having built it, and given the goofiness and intransigence of the Japanese government, using it was the best way to end the war.

HBO is running its series "The Pacific" now, and I can hardly bear to watch. But really, namvet, how can we judge the Japanese Army as having been "more brutal" than the Nazi Army? The Japanese did not engage in systematic genocide with their army.

I know -- a little -- about things such as the Bataan Death March. Thank God, Daddy was not a POW and came home in one piece, at least physically. But are you really saying the Japanese Army deserved brutality from the US in a way that the German Army did not ?

It's just hard to imagine any human evil will ever rival the Death Camps.

American POWs were treated well by the Germans. They didn't' go on suicide missions, and they would surrender. What was happening to the Jews was separate from other war efforts, which the german soldiers likely didn't even know about while they were fighting the war.

Japanese tortured and abused POWs, if not straight up kill them. THey killed and brutalized so many civilians in the lands they captured. They were by far much more fucked up than the germans. holocaust aside

In the context of the time and the number of people who had already been killed on both sides, I would say the first bomb was ethical to end the war.

I still can't understand why it was necessary to drop a second bomb only three days later. We had already made our point with Hiroshima...Nagasaki was overkill

READ the source documents. After the first Bomb the Generals that ran the Government REFUSED to surrender. The Emperor refused to act after the first bomb also. It is all there. The second bomb is what convinced the Emperor to order a surrender.
