The St. Louis Rams fired coach Steve Spagnuolo and general manager Billy Devaney, the team announced on Monday.

The 52-year-old Spagnuolo was just 10-38 in three seasons in St. Louis after being hired in January 2009. Devaney, 56, was promoted to general manager in December 2008.

Who's next?? And is Spagnuolo that good of a Defensive Coach to now be wanted by everyone?????

1. I don't think Norv is going to make it. I still don't get what everyone sees in him as a head coach.
