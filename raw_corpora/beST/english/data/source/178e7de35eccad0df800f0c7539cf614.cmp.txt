Over these past two years, I have noticed an increasing amount of anti-Iranian news reports which have culminated in the recent attacks on the British Embassy with both countries expelling our respective Diplomats. It now seems certain to me that within the next decade the U.K and U.S.A among others will be involved in a fully fledged war against Iran. Throughout history, the expelling of Diplomats has usually meant one thing and when this is coupled with the Arab Spring alongside general unrest for a long period in Iran, it seems inevitable we are heading towards another war.

As a general question, I would like to ask others to see what you think? Are we going to war, what can we do to avoid this and just in general for people to air their opinions on another war in the Middle East.

P.S. Just to clarify I am neither anti nor pro war, this is just a launch pad for a discussion.

Given the Israeli mentality I would say we will see them strike Iran. Would't be shocked if they used nukes either tbh

That is a big claim, it would quite an amazing escalation if Israel used nuclear bombs on Iran.

I know, however Israel is going to know that if they strike Iran Iran will hit back. Conventional weapons may not even be able to hit some of the fortified facilities either. The idea of a single debilitating strike on Iran that will stop it ever being able to strike back is going to be very very tempting for Israel. And depending on which way the American election goes American support may not be forthcoming if someone like Ron Paul gets elected

Yeah but you cannot just throw around nuclear bombs without huge geopolitical consequences.

If they have/get nukes, no one's invading Iran.

I personally think it would be cool, Israel might have to think twice before carrying out major bombings in Palastine etc. There will always be that deterrant if Iran gets nukes.

Of course not but the question is fast becoming not will Israel strike but when and how. A conventional strike on Iran is going to raise massive geopolitical consequences too. Including huge damage to the world economy and the possible destruction of Israel.
