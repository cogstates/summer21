Look at what he said when he was running for president. He has said that he wants to "fundamentally transform" the country into something completely different, and I just don't think that sounds like something someone who loves his people and country would say. He wants the role of United States diminished among the countries of the world.

As for anti-american policies, there are so many. Here are some
He wants to take away free choice with regard to healthcare and put government in charge. America was founded on free markets and capitalism so this is anti-american
He has taken over many american businesses, again going against american free market principles.
He is trying to silence radio talk show hosts like rush limbaugh by implementing a regulatory scheme that would impose government controls on content instead of letting the free markets decide what the content should be. This is in violation of free speech, another principle this country was founded on.
He is trying to use the FCC to control internet content, because he knows that as long as there is free speech online, people will be critical of him
He has had many loud and very public battles with fox news and rush limbaugh. He wants a single party press, not the free one that we have now.
He has repeatedly said that now that he is in power, the opposition should just shut up and get out of the way, and that goes against the first amendment.
He wants to take away our second amendment, the right to bear arms, which is an american civil liberty going back to the time the country was founded.
He believes in higher taxes and with more money taxed from people, they have less economic civil liberty. More powerful government means less power for the people. I believe that raising taxes is anti-american.

You are twisting various things he has done, also democrats would have done at least 70% of the same thing. Just because your political allegiance is to GOP and not him, doesnt mean that he is anti-American...just means that he is a Democrat no?
But no, I dont believe he is Anti-American at allll

Come on, you know thats rubbish..

Also dont make me laugh, American Free Market?...Why did you give so much money to Wall Street then?..if you were really free market, you'd have let them all crash and burn..btw this wasnt just Obama but also Bush!..so Bush is Anti-American now right?

Bush was wrong to try to bail everything out too. I was not a fan of Bush, he was a left wing progressive who was almost as bad as Obama

Mitt Romney is in my opinion, the American version of David Cameron. In other words - a conservative in name only. I have been very disappointed with Cameron, and greatly wish that there was a real Conservative in charge of the Conservative Party and the country.

Some would argue that Romney is the only candidate who can beat Obama, since he is a moderate who can appeal to swing voters. The same sort of thing was said about Cameron - that the Tories needed someone like him to detoxify the brand and appeal to all of society. In both cases this is, in my opinion, nonsense. Ronald Reagan ran from an ideologically truly conservative platform. He won against Carter (who was very similar to Obama) and got re-elected with one of the biggest landslides ever. Also, in Britain, Margaret Thatcher who ran from ideologically truly conservative platform, was re-elected with a landslide not once but twice. What did wishy washy liberal "conservative" Cameron achieve? A hung parliament when the election was an open goal.

If Romney gets the nomination, he will lose. America needs a Reagan, and Britain needs a Thatcher.

The problem with that thinking is that you ignore 30 years of political development. Thatcher and Reagan both beat ideological left wingers in Callahan and Carter.
Whatever you think about Obama, he is quite centralist with a lot of his failings coming from the fact he has tried to work across the aisle even when he had a supermajority.

Since 1992 both the UK and the US and seen the left triangulate the right through 'third way' to capture the centre ground leading to the electoral success of Clinton and New Labour. A right wing ideologue won't win now as they need to win the centre who generally prefer more moderate candidates.
