Bill Maher Saturday said America loves its military members the way disgraced football player Michael Vick loves dogs.

In his HBO special "Bill Maher...But I'm Not Wrong," the outspoken comedian went on a vulgarity-laden two-minute rant against Republicans and the troops.

BILL MAHER: For the longest time, every Republican election has been based on some sentimental bulls**t: the flag, or the flagpin, or the Pledge, or the, "It's morning in America." Bill Clinton got a blowjob in the Oval Office. And the Dixie Chicks insulted President Bush on foreign soil. And when that happens, it hurts the feelings of our troops. And then Tinkerbell's light goes out and she dies. Yes, yes, the love of our troops, the ultimate in fake patriotism. Are you kidding? The troops, we pay them like s**t, we f**k them and trick them on deployment, we nickel and dime them on medical care when they get home, not to mention the stupid wars that we send them to. Yeah, we love the troops the way Michael Vick loves dogs. You know how I would feel supported if I was a troop overseas? If the people back home were clamoring to get me out of this pointless errands. That's how I would feel supported. But, you know, don't hold your breath on that one fellas because, you know, when America invades a country, we love you long time. Seriously, we never, we leave like Irish relatives: not at all.

Honestly, is this REALLY what HBO wants broadcast on its network?

He's not wrong. Why don't you go look at the number of soldiers who have had to stay well beyond their initial employment contract. Or the number of soldiers who get classified as having "personality disorders" instead of PTSD.

Or why don't you go talk to Pat Tillman or countless other families who can't get the truth from the Military about their loved ones death or get the benefits that they well deserve.

And the fact we not only went to Iraq but had troops lose their lives is a tragedy in itself.

He's not ranting against the troops. He's ranting against people like you likely.

Oh, and never mind the fact it took years to get our troops serving overseas to get proper body armor. And to this day, some of them still do not have proper equipment.

Can you ever imagine being a parent who has to go to a pawn shop to get body armor for your son because the government is too cheap to provide it because they feel it is not cost effective for your son to be worth a couple extra hundred dollars? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_eh.gif"/>

I'd say you put your foot in your mouth, but you just can't seem to get your head out of your ass long enough at one time to do so.
