texas has the most hard core criminal justice system in the country.
Is it a possibility there is another side to this? Is it a possibility that this young man and his friend did not rape this girl?
Is it a possibility abc news has blown this out of proportion, twisted and distorted the facts?
Texas criminal courts and prosecutors do not coddle to anyone. The football argument is an old one, not happening these days. Players these days get 4 game suspensions for selling a t shirt on e-bay.

i'd never heard of this case until now. So, i googled it to get more information. Even the information that is available is fuzzy. But it appears the prosecution struck a deal because of a lack of evidence. It seems the prosecutor is saying that everyone involved was drunk/drinking and that the stories told had holes in them.......all of them. Hence, the 'slap on the wrists'. I'm all for women/girls being able to do everything they want, in theory. However, the reality of the situation is that 16 year old girls should not place themselves in situations like this (drinking to apparent excess) while at a party not chaperoned by an adult. That said, young men should also not put themselves in that exact same situation because if you can't recount accurately what happened because you were drunk, you cannot say for sure what did or did not happen. As for the race angle, it is unecessary. This would have been no better or worse had the accused kids been white.

Well then, why is it a HATE CRIME when a White person does it to a Black but not a HATE CRIME when it's the other way around?

</quote>

I don't think it is a race issue either. They need to throw these punks in jail!

Although you do make a good point that it's only a hate crime if a white person picks on a black person. If it's the other way around it's no big deal for some reason.

You are an idiot. I don't like obama because he is a socialist pig. If the perps are black they are still guilty. I am tired of thugs crying that they get in trouble just because they are black and that society made them do it, bull!!!! They are thugs and deserve a bullet.

You need to learn the definition of socialist, then readjust your priorities. Nevertheless, the whole stereotype you described is complete bullshit.

Funny you should say that. A cousin of mine was raped a long time ago, the guy that did it commit suicide shortly after - blew his own head off with a shotgun.

BIG QUESTION!

Why the hell do guys rape women anyway?

Women are horny as hell! All you have to do is be nice to them and they'll pretty much accomodate you in any way you want. Yes, sometimes you have to give them time to think about it....

Besides which sex with women that are voluntarily engaged is an awful lot better.

Young guys need a talkin' to...

A talking to? How about jail?

16 year old girls do not consent to gang rape. No matter how "horny" or drunk they are.

Why is the title of your thread so insidious? Why not a title lie "School Officials Screw over Rape Victim?"

That one would be more accurate.
