- Many people here and elsewhere continue to suggest Paterno not doing more made him an enabler of child sexual abuse. This is by and large an incredibly unfair label to stick on him. For one, had the investigation back in 1998 been handled correctly this would never have become an issue. So, far more to the truth, ALL those who failed back in 1998 are the true enablers. Secondly, several people either witnessed or were directly told of Sandusky raping a young boy in the showers in 2000 and they did NOTHING. They did not stop it, they did not report it. They swallowed their tongues. They are all far more culpable than Paterno.

What do all these things that other people did or didn't do have to do with judging Paterno's actions? He can't be a child abuse enabler because other people also had a chance to do something and didn't? That's must makes all of them enablers, including Paterno.

Another point: With the benefit of hindsight we are outraged by the 40 counts related to sexual abuse and 9 or more victims. But that's the result of an investigation that went on for over three years. We assume Paterno had to know a lot since he was everything to Penn State, but how much did he really know? As far as I know, it was the 1998 and 2002 incidents, nothing more. Should that be enough?.. yeah, I think so. But it's NOT the 40 counts and 9+ victims everyone is judging him by. I think in order to form a final opinion of just how culpable Paterno truly is, we have to first understand exactly what he knew, both in terms of the allegations made against Sandusky and what actions were taken to resolve it. How many times do we hear the phrase "how could they not have seen what was going on" when in fact, they honestly didn't. (this speaks directly to the accusation of being an enabler, which to me is a conscious action or role. But if you simply did not see what was going on, for whatever reason, then you can't be an enabler).

I can't speak for anyone else, but my decision is based solely on the fact that, regardless of how the 1998 incidents turned out, Paterno deliberately downplayed the 2002 incident while knowing that Sandusky had been accused before for the same thing by different kids. I'm judging him on what he did, not how many counts Sandusky was indicted on.

And finally, I have often heard the commentary that this was a cover-up to protect the school or football program, but I still don't understand what this exactly means. Typically, if you are protecting the school or football program, you are hiding activity taken by the school or football program that benefited the school or the football program. But when it was first discovered that Sandusky was sexually abusing children, this had nothing to do with the school or the football program per se. It was entirely about a sexual predator that managed to operate within the confines of the school and it's football program while going undetected. The school had nothing to gain but everything to lose by hiding it. Exactly how would it have hurt the school or the football program if Sandusky was exposed right from the start? And remember, back in 1998 the relationship between Paterno and Sandusky was very strained. They never really cared for one another to begin with, but it had gotten far worse over the last few years Sandusky was there. To suggest that Paterno would have known exactly what Sandusky was alleged to have done and opted to protect him, for reasons I can't fathom, seems very unlikely. So what am I missing??

Paterno lost his job because of what Sandusky did. Surely he was intelligent enough to foresee that possibility. I'm not sure it's beyond the pale to suggest that Paterno may have considered his own firing to be a negative turn of events that the football program needed to be protected from.

I have participated actively in this thread for a few reasons. One is that it's helped me come to grips with this tragedy that implicates people and an institution that I admire(d). A big reason, though, has been for accuracy's sake. I know a lot more about Paterno than most people do, and characterizations of him as some evil mastermind valuing a winning football program above all else - morality be damned - are flat wrong. If for no other purpose than for people who don't know anything about the man to get the tragic irony of this case (i.e., that it involves the squeakiest of the squeaky-clean) it's been important to set the record straight. It's easy to just conclude that his response makes him a total low-life; the truth is more complicated: he really is a man of impeccable character who did absolutely the wrong thing when presented with this situation, and he deserves to be punished for it.

Vicki Triponey's comments suggest that he did indeed value his football program above many more important things. Power corrupts, and this scandal has shown pretty clearly that Paterno was no exception to that rule.

I'm sorry, but I think you're reacting out of emotion because you bought into the myth of Paterno as the squeakiest of the squeaky clean. He was not some wonderful man who inexplicably did a bad thing. He was a fallible being, like all of us, who did good and bad things. Better he should be remembered that way than as some phony secular saint.
