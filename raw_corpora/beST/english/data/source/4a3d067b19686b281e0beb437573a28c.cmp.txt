This is one of the worst posts I've seen on TSR regarding Israel, and believe me, there's a lot to choose from.

First of all, Jews did not immigrate to the point where they formed a majority:

Secondly, the Jews did not divide Mandated Palestine nor was the idea to establish a Jewish homeland based on guilt from the Holocaust - how can you even say this nonsense? The only thing the Holocaust did was underline the need for a Jewish homeland, an idea that that really came to fruition in the late 1800's when Theodore Herzl lead the First Zionist Congress which then lead to the creation of the the World Zionist Organization. The pledge to create a Jewish homeland in Palestine came about with the Balfour Deceleration in 1917 which was incorporated into a peace treaty during the San Remo conference in 1920 (which included Britain, France, Italy, Japan and the US) - this is at least 2 decades before WW2 started.

Expanding on the above, the idea to partition Palestine originated around 1937 with the Peel Commission which was then followed up by the Woodhead Commission (later evaluated at the St. James Conference) - these were British en-devours, not nefarious Jewish plans. The idea to partition arose due to the understanding that Jewish and Arab interests were irreconcilable - during this, violence was increasing more and more. The British wanted out of Palestine as soon as possible and as such, they handed power over to the UN in 1947. The UN then established UNSCOP to devise a solution and they too came up with a partition plan which took the form of a GA resolution - Israel declared independence according to the partition plan a day before the British Mandate was due to expire and in 1949 they were admitted to the UN so no, the Jews did not exceed their authority, gain a majority through immigration or come up with a nefarious plan to split Palestine.

Here's a tip for you. If you don't want to expose yourself as being an anti-Semitic moron, then try not to say things like "I had a feeling you were a Jew" or "...Defender of the Jews", trying replacing the word "Jew" with "Zionist", it's much more covert. Don't bother trying to say "but but I can't be antisemitic because Arabs are Semitic and I don't mind them!" - the term antisemitism was coined by the Jew-hating German Wilhelm Marr in 1987~ and as such refers to Jews, not Semitic people.

I guess, according to your "logic", Palestinians aren't allowed to 'defend' themselves because the bastards have a habit of killing innocent Jews spanning from 1920 up until 2011 <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:"/>

According to <a href="http://israelipalestinian.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000636#chart1">http://israelipalestinian.procon.org...=000636#chart1</a>,
Jews were in the majority from about 1950 onwards. As you can see from your charts, they increased as a percentage of the total population steadily before that (although there was a big jump in 1948, when some 850 000 jewish people immigrated)

I believe there is little general denial that the western european states looked upon the setting up of a Jewish state a lot more favourably after WW2. That does not mean it was a nefarious plan. However they did mass immigrate, both before it became a state and afterwards. They then took control.

According to my logic, you should punish the perpetrators, instead of a group of people which includes the perpetrators. The state is not responsible as a whole for the firing of rockets. However they are all punished. The entire point of discrimination is to group a number of people together and act like they are all responsible for what a small percentage of that group has participated in. Examples are people who blame every algerian immigrant they see for theft because algerians have a higher crime rate on average in their country, or all the christian democrats getting murdered in a 1930s German city because 2 resisted the SS or SA.

However you might turn it, you have a colony in 1890 with 2% of its population being jewish. In 1947 that is 33% ( <a href="http://www.representativepress.org/IsraelHistory.html">http://www.representativepress.org/IsraelHistory.html</a> ). They obtain control, do not listen to what the UN tells them to do and discriminate against the population which used to compromise 98% of the population 60 years ago. That is the fundamental fear of western societies who are afraid of immigration.

They have now almost split up into two separate countries, where some inhabitants of one send a few rockets to the other side once a while. The other side has invaded with soldiers and tanks, decided what is allowed into the country and harasses people from the other side several times a day (when they cross checkpoints or the border). The division is nowhere near to how the UN decided the country should be divided.

I strongly hope that on one side the new Egyptian government will open the border to allow any non-arms kind of trade (such as building materials) and that the Israeli government realizes that laws regarding freedom of speech issues (such as a ban on speaking in favour of boycotting products from Israeli settlements based in Palestinia) only create more frustration and are not in its long-term interest.

Because they people they are supposedly being 'defending' themselves against are systematically having their rights taken away by Israeli foreign policy who insist they life in a state of complete autonomy with no world recognition or any equality - and for that matter, subjecting Palestinians to torture, regularly bombing schools and hospitals and refusing to allow them the basic tools and materials to rebuild their society and economy.

I completely agree!
As an individual who is of Jewish descent, (I am also of Arab descent) I do not agree with the mistreatment of anyone. Be it from my own people or not.
