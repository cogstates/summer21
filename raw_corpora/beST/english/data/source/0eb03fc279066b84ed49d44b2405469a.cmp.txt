The Federal Asset Forfeiture Program where people involved in criminal activity have their assets seized and sold by the Federal government is under fire for selling goods far below their actual value and for selling assets...

<quote>
without public notice or competitive bidding, and that Mr. Briskman assessed the value of certain assets, found buyers through his “business contacts,” and kept a secret bank account to which government auditors had no access.

This is what we all feared was going on anyway. The Forfeiture program is just a way for federal employees to enrich themselves at the expense of victims of crimes. Instead of getting a fair amount for seized assets, they are sold off to "friends" for far less than their actual value, without public notice, in secret.

Why is this program allowed to continue, when it only breeds more criminal activity?

The Federal Asset Forfeiture Program is a joke, and I believe a very strong reason that law enforcement does not want to see cannabis laws change. The ex-sheriff in my town used to drive around in a fancy Cadillac seized in a drug bust. I never could wrap my mind around the fact that your home could be seized because you grow a few plants. But it makes sense, if they take all your stuff not only do they make money but it deprives you of collateral you might need to hire a lawyer that might actually get you off the BS charges. Something needs to change before we aren't a so called democracy anymore.

It is all a criminal enterprise. The U.S. Marshalls are perhaps not the worst pigs (see the article on John T. Williams shooting), but you might just be wearing their handcuffs just before or after you read this.

When are the pigs going to realize that the shit they are handing out will be shoved straight back in their faces?
