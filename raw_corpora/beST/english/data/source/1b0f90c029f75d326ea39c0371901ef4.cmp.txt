Remember that corporate oil deal where the Chinese wanted to buy out Unocal? It didn't go through because, as I read in an opinion or editorial piece somewhere, "The political climate wasn't right." In other words Americans weren't happy having one of their howegrown oil companies owned by Commie China.

Well on our recent trip "out west" I was surprised to see a local newspaper headline about "Chinese rigs and work gangs" on Colorado's western slope near Pyramid where they've already "drilled and flared" a couple oil wells. Sounds like the Communists are invading and drilling on American terra firma and I didn't even know it.

So it's an economic not a military invasion. But who'd have thought it.

This development is interesting because it raises a lot of fascinating questions about economic management. About central vs local or market control. What mix of communism and capitalism is China pursuing? How well are the Chinese managing their economy? Are they doing better or is there a trend of their ultimately doing better serving their people than the US?

It's not a new idea of course that a combination of capitalism and communism may work better than either one alone, i.e. small scale marketing in a larger communist context.

(As everyone already knows I'm not an economic theory marxist (at this point I reserve the right to plead ignorance on the matter) but when it comes to promoting fairness in an unfair world consider me a hardcore communist.)

What we have in America right now is a combination of Capitalism and Communism (ie: socialism), and I don't think it's working to the benefit of anyone but the Elite. More and more people are losing jobs to outsourcing, while small businesses are going belly-up as corporate power becomes more and more centralized. This is exactly what Communism is: Monopoly Capitalism in the hands of an elite few -- the centralization of money and power.

This country is controlled by communists, whether you or anyone else in here agrees with it or not.

The same people behind China's economic upsurge are the same people behind America's economic decline. It's all being controlled, manipulated and planned from behind the scenes by the Global Elite and their CFR/Trilateral/Bilderberg minions.

Sorry, socialism?! a society of equals in which the economy is run democratically! Look like america. But yeh america is happy to deal with china now, infact its pracitcally eonomically dependant on it. They seem to have completley forgotten about tainememan spr. I dont see whats changed so radically in china since then.

No, that is NOT what Communism is. (please read the communist manifesto on Hippy.com)

What you are referring to is Oligarchy:
Oligarchy: rule by a few members of a community or group. When referring to governments, the classical definition of oligarchy, as given for example by Aristotle, is of government by a few, usually the rich, for their own advantage.

Communism in it's pure form is communal ownership of all property. In fact Communism historically takes the property from the oligarchy and redistributes it, decentralizes it into communes that govern themselves. Where it goes wrong in practice is when they create a central government to control the communes. Keep the communes and leave the rest.

I recommend a good polysci/history course.

Again I would like to know where you are getting this bullcrap from, Rat. You're definitely slipping. Or maybe you got such good shit you're hallucinating. (if so pass it around!)

And Rat, you think the global elite are manipulating China?

Just what are you reading?

Even the Japanese had a hard time manipulating China when they were occupying it (they only ever got part of it). Not too different from the US occupying Iraq in fact.

Did you really write that post? Are you feeling ok?

I think you've come down with CTD, conspiracy theory disease.

You should see Dr. Reality for a checkup.

Skip, that's also very true. The U$ ruling class cannot wait to get it's hnds on the markets in china. Now as for communism in china since when? Even when it really was going about claiming to be communist china was really infact just another stalinist dictatorship. I wouldnt bother explaining this to rat however becuase we're all clearley pawns in the hands of the illuminati anyway.
