Hello,

I am new to this forum as such and just searching through some topics and see quite a few related to the end and i will share my considerable compelling view that Tony Blair is going to be the antichrist. It's beyond doubt for me now. I first had thoughts it could be him about 10 months ago but it was just 90% speculation. Now its 95% certainty.

Let me explain

First of all what alarmed me to the fact that he is the man of sin and a candidate was that after he left the British Parliament as Prime Minister he was appointed middle-east envoy for peace which we all know the antichrist must bring peace to the middle-east

Blair appointed Middle East envoy - google it

Secondly then not to long afterwards Blair converts to catholicism which the antichrist many agree has to have ties with as the catholic church will play a important part in the coming lie

Tony Blair joins Catholic Church - google it

Thirdly he has purchased a palace in Jerusalem for him and his family to live in and he is also of European descent

Blair to inspect Jerusalem palace as home for his peace envoy role - google it

Then he is the most likely candidate to be president of the new EU constitution which will come into effect very soon despite Ireland's rejection of the treaty as Brussels is pushing for

Tony Blair could be EU President - google it

Then he is well mannered and people look up to him and a man who is smart and understands riddles i expect and he has just been recently nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize

Then

Blair could be next World Bank president - google it
Which would give him standing to use this to bring about a one monetary system spoken of in Revelation 13

Then most recently he has set up a new faith foundation in which it is his goal "to tackle global poverty, challenge conflict and unite the world's religions". A one world religion united so that all faiths can be gathered together into a new greater belief system and become one.

Check it out...there's a speech by him on the bbc link

Blair launches faith foundation
google it

Does anything here make anyone think that it could be him? he is fulfilling all that is required of the antichrist and is progressing even saying in his new faith venture

In an earlier interview with Time magazine, Mr Blair, who is now a peace envoy to the Middle East, said the foundation was "how I want to spend the rest of my life".

I swear you protestants think everyone in some type of leadership role is the antichrist. First it was Bush, then the Pope, then Benny Hinn, and now Tony Blair. Does anyone even take this garbage seriously these days? Nearly everyone that you have accused to be the "antichrist" has now either died or is almost out of power, &lt;Staff Edit&gt;

*I don't like Tony Blair by the way*

Revelations 13 : 3One of the heads of the beast seemed to have had a fatal wound, but the fatal wound had been healed. The whole world was astonished and followed the beast.
