The Affordable Health Care may be dead but does this make the Right Wingers the Death Panels that they lied would be set up by the Bill?

Jonathan Cohn calls it a <a href="http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_treatment/archive/2009/08/11/squeeze-play.aspx">squeeze play</a> but whatever you call it theres something bizarre about watching an American conservative movement whose general goal is to have the public sector provide as little as possible to anyone, and whose specific goal is to prevent public policy from extending health insurance to the tens of millions of currently un- or under-insured Americans, posing as the defenders of the right to access to generous health care services.
And of course the right-wing does want people to have access to generous health care servicesrich people. Others will just have to, you know, get sick and die for the sake of free market principles. As Joe Conason says <a href="http://www.politickerny.com/4866/real-death-panels">these are the real death panels</a> : When Republican politicians and right-wing talking heads bemoan the fictitious death panels that they claim would arise from health care reform, they are concealing a sinister reality from their followers. The ugly fact is that every year we fail to reform the existing system, that failure condemns tens of thousands of people to die either because they have no insurance or because their insurance companies deny coverage or benefits when they become ill.
The best estimate of the annual death toll among Americans of working age due to lack of insurance or under-insurance is at least 20,000, according to studies conducted over the past decade by medical researchers, and is almost certainly rising as more and more people lose their coverage as costs continue to go up.
They die primarily because they didnt have the coverage or the money to pay doctors and thus delayed seeking treatment until it was too late. They dont get checkups, screenings and other preventive care. That is why uninsured adults are far more likely to be diagnosed with a disease, such as cancer or heart disease, at an advanced stage, which severely reduces their chances of survival.

I think my realization that under the present system health care is provided on the basis of one's wealth came about when I went to a private hospital that did not take Medicaid to pick up a newborn being placed for adoption (that child's grandparents were well insured) and I noticed they had valet parking. Typical Dallas, where one's worth and bank account are perceived as one and the same.

I reached my conclusion that the US industry is insane after living there for University. Thankfully I had coverage. I had abdominal pain at 11PM or so. Went to the university health clinic in my PJs basically - so I forgot my card. They poked around, suspected appendicitis. Sent me to the local ER.

I spent one night in ER. I had about 20 minutes with a doctor. I had 3 x-rays, and 1 CT scan. They said I could sort out the insurance after I got my bill.

The bill for that huge travail (I didn't have appendicitis - just an obstruction that came unblocked)? $12,000. That's right, if I was poor or self-employed and didn't have insurance, I would have been on the hook for $12,000. Since graduating I've worked two years. I saved more than 50% of my disposable income for law school. I currently have maybe $18K US. That would have basically wiped out my life plans and ability to go to school.

People are facing choices about whether to ruin their lives - or potentially lose their lives. When you have people hesitant to undergo simple tests like a CT scan because they're afraid they'll lose their life savings - even when the trade off is a chance of death; your system is barbaric, wrong, and must be torn down immediately.
