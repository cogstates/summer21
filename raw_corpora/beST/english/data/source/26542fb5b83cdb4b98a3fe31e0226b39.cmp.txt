Each state cannot prepare for a mega disaster. Having the Federal Government prepared to bring disaster relief where it is needed is more cost effective than 50 states preparing for a disaster that may never come

Look at the massive fires in Arizona and California last years. Those states cannot afford to keep the manpower and equipment on hand to battle thousands of square miles of fire. The Federal Government is able to bring in personnel and resources from around the country

Why exactly can't each state be prepared for a mega disaster?

look at hurricane katrina. do you think LA alone could have prepared for that? lousiana only has 4.5 million people. Hurricane katrina cost approx $110B in damage. that means each resident would be responsible for approx $25k worth of the damage. that is unrealistic

Loisiana is one of our poorest states. They also get much more federal aid than they pay in taxes If they were expected to be responsible for all the disaster cleanup they would have gone bankrupt. As it is......ALL Americans helped them in their time of need and that is the way it should be

You can't be serious. No relief for disaster victims is one of Paul's most popular spiels. Go to Youtube and do a search on "Ron Paul against FEMA". You can watch him rail against disaster relief till your heart's content.

How is it possible for you guys to have so little knowledge about your presidential candidates?

You seriously scare me.

Yeah, FEMA's Katrina effort was an epic performance. Upgrade that unit. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif"/>

FEMA under Bush was in itself a disaster. We all know that.

FACT is that FEMA and Homeland Security under Obama works very well.

LOOK IT UP.

That isn't how it works, dingleberry. You brought up how well they work under your supreme leader. Now let's see some insttances where that is true. I'll wait.

And that's because the State governments have ceded too much power to the Feds. If we fixed that problem, the States would have significantly more resources and be able to help themselves.

That and they think there is "free" money available, of course they are going to ask. I think they would be better off without the Feds.

lulz. Having been in direct aid to VT, and Ny myself, the only reason FEMA was even remotely effective is because of class A ground work by the states. Oh, and the fact they didn't have to actually consult with states they just moved right in thanks to congress giving them broadened authority.

Without local know how, they would have botched the deal just as bad as Katrina. Hence, they are not really worth having adn should dismantled to the state level. We have national guard for when the statre requires tactical help such as Irene.

if that's all FEMA has going for it, it isn't much at all.

Nuts. My heart goes out to the people in tornado alley and I have no problem with my tax dollars going to help the survivors rebuild their lives.

Classic Ron Paul.

At least in Ron Paul's world the tornado victims will have legalized drugs and prostitiution to comfort them.

A democrat speaking out against personal liberties, while speaking in favor of spreading the wealth around, not so rare anymore.

There's neocons who pretend to be conservative but don't care about budgets and spending, and neolibs like Chris who pretend to be liberal but hate the idea of personal liberties.

</quote>

You are such an emotional little twit, derp. There is NO AUTHORIZATION for the Federal government to do the things you want it to do so you can FEEL GOOD. Usurping the Constitution every time you turn around isn't good for it (adherence) or the People (dependency)

If you want to me to put it in comparable terms, Democrats are fucking spoiled babies.
