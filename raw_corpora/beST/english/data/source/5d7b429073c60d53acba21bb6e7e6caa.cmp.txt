<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-15410154">What great news!</a> President Obama's habit of playing everything close does nothing to alleviate my personal tension, but as a Commander-in-Chief, who has been better? Do you have to go back to Roosevelt?

The dang irony of it all is that it may have been Iraq's refusal to give immunity to Little Bush's Blackwater mercenaries that provided the sticking point in negotiations, which possibly forced Obama to take his team and go home. I am not saying the Iraqis would rather foreign troops occupy their country further, but the cards had to be played correctly for this to happen now.

Well, it seems that Clinton has been playing tough with Pakistan lately, maybe they're trying to set up an exit here too.

One can hope.

Afghanistan would support Pakistan in case of military conflict between Pakistan and the United States, Afghan President Hamid Karzai said in an interview to a private Pakistani TV channel broadcast on Saturday.

keeping 15K troops or so in Iraq would have been wise. There is hope in Iraq.

I am angry at republicans who scream that Obama team is incompetent for not being able to negotiate these terms. They don't know the inner workings of the Iraqi government, I expect the U.S. had no choice but get the hell out.

It appears to me that we are doing more harm than good in Afghanistan and should get completely out of Af-Pak militarily.

Congrads President Obama, but a question remains. Why would a man who hates America so much allow his bodyguards to stock up on Coke and Pepsi?

while i'm psyched that we are at least ending one war, all the news articles are pretty explicit, we are ending the war not because the Us gov't wanted it to end, but because the Iraqi gov't refused to let us stay.

Its great news but it has nothing to do with Obama being a great commander in chief.

I agree we're getting out because Iraq wants us out, and it's not because of Obama's diplomacy skills, but I still think you do him a diservice.

A Republican president would have said no.
