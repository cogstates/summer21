I believe these rows will just keep getting worse for years to come.

Problem I see is not the color of people that live in here and not from where they come.

But that when someone who is not from here decides to reside in Britain, they do not adapt to Britain, they want Britain to adapt to them.

I do feel unpleasant about these statistics of white race extinction, it's basically telling us that within next centuries we'll be minority in countries that were once ours? countries that will be ruled by few or more generation old foreigners that didn't really have to change anything to adapt and be somewhat British.
Another issue is how on earth is it going to be with language, imagine the pot of cultures and nationalities in this country that's going to grow, it's a fact that a very mere number of foreigners can actually speak excellent English, there's a lot with bad accents from other parts of world, not everybody even knows how to call some things. Funny thing is that even some British don't have superb English. Anyway this is just vision of language nightmare.

Main issue I see is identity. Would this country really have a point anymore, if minority think of themselves as British. another part is thinking their British when actually they are just 2nd generation immigrants.. Maybe European countries will just merge into something new, where white people are minority, nationality is just something from history book and we're just big mixed up culture of people, creating some sort of new culture with ingredients from all parts of world. I guess that's the most probable future.

This seems to come up a lot as well, as a matter fo fact countries were better off under British rule..bring British ideas and industry to places of no hope.

Zimbabwe used to be stable until the Brits left and Mugabe went mental and started killing and exiling the minority white people as some sort of 'get back' plan.

Zimbabwe since then is a right dump going no where.

Also i dont see thre being white majority groups in those countries, if anything they are getting smaller.
There was no mass immigration to India for example.

What about the fact that many of these colonies had men fight for Britain during wars? They put their lives on the line for this country and what now you're saying that they don't have as much right to be here as you because you are paler? <img src="images/smilies/s-smilie.gif"/> <img src="images/smilies/s-smilie.gif"/> Anyway, I am going to sleep, so goodnight. I'll reply another time. Oh yeah, they colonised us, so why can't we colonise them? hmmmm good question that init? lol.

ps. we are not trying to colonise you hahha.

Lol the amount of times i have heard this, it's drummed into you from television, radio and education.

"if everyone was the same it would be boring"

Why exactly would it be boring? is japan boring? is china boring? is ghana boring?

It's brainwashing at it's finest, every race has a right to exist, the planet is diverse enough.

It's true what people say, if you want different cultures then go visit them.

This is England, we are a 3rd world dumping ground for some reason.. being forced on the native populace, we don't want 200 nationalities here...is it so wrong keeping Britain white? after all the whites have occupied this land sicne the dawn of man.

You have been brainwashed to believe that this country needs diversity to survive, it does not..it didnt need it in the past and it does not need it now.

By the way i live in Central London...i know what im talking about.

Edit: lol at neg rep, the left have really drummed in you lot well. a shame.

no its not. Colonialism was forced on the native populations by the white invaders. We live in a democracy and can vote for people who represent our views. If people don't like something and can't live here, they know what they can do....

The Anglo Saxon tribes displaced and in many cases intermarried with the local populations, let alone the waves of immigration, intermarrying over the last couple of thousand years we can not positively say that we know what the genetic code of the Pictish and other pre-Roman tribes was, all we can do is make assumptions based on what we know about other races genes makeup.

We have a good idea of native Icelandic, Scandanavian, etc genetic makeup due to the lack of immigration there, many people in the North and Nothern Isles of Scotland can trace their genetic lineage back to the Icelandic, etc countries due to this effectively untainted sample.
