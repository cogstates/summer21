Labour are a left wing socialist party. They are pro immigration if it supports the economy and believe in equal rights for all individuals. They are traditionally more likely and are known for allowing immigrants into the country - hence they were his target. The labour party was responsible for the current state of immigration in the country, and in his own ideology, he wanted to take our future labour politicians (which those in the camp were potentially) from getting into power and allowing more in.

In his mind, by taking them out, he can prevent future immigration.

He basically hates Islam and believes that Islamic immigration is a huge threat to Europe. He thinks that European politicians are allowing the colonisation of Europe by Muslims and so are all legitimate targets. He thinks we need to deport all Muslims from Europe Turkey North Iran and Palestine.

He attacked his own kind because killing Muslims would lead to them being replaced by more Muslims. So instead he decided to take out "the next generation of Left wing seeds". In short he has wiped out a number of potential future left wing politicians. He also sees himself a bit like a templar knight defending Christianity from Islam

This is a bit of a myth. Oslo is a hugely multicultural and as far as I'm aware, Norway as a whole is about on par with the UK in terms of different ethnic groups. It's a myth British people seem to have that the UK is one of the most multicultural places in Europe, when in reality Sweden, the Netherlands and possibly Norway are notably more so.
