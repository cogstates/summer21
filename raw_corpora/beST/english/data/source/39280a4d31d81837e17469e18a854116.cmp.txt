I have been seperated from my ex for now 2 yrs, we have 2 children together, he seems every fortnight from friday after school till sunday 5 o'clock, and some time more when he wanted them. All was fine until the subject of maintenance was brought up, he was giving £25 a week for both children but also said he would provied things such as nappies and school clothes but he never did, but since he never did a was wanting to ask for an extra £5 for both of them,he refused and phoned straight away the csa who says he should give £36 a week for the children and he also ran to a solicitor claiming i don't let him see the children, so we was suppose to go to mediation to resolve that issue but he canceled it. He now wants to go to court for a contact order.
we also had a mortgage togethere, and says he will only remove my name if i gave parental responsability for my eldestwich i have never denied him from having.
When he has the children he is always texting over silling little things but being quite mean about it and wants to get the social service involved.
It's starting to be quite a headhache and realy don't not what to do and where i stand in all off this.

1. Don't ask for help from internet forums on such important issues.

2. Speak to a solicitor.

Hi Pimky,

Im sorry your having such a rough time at the moment, ex's can be a nightmare!

My husband has been going through courts trying to see his daughter for the past 8 years and basically most judges will want the children to have stability, The judge granted us access every other weekend from Fri after school to Sun afternoon which is what your ex was having so i think that is acceptable,

If you explain to your lawyer that you want your children to see their dad every other weekend as before then its likely his laywer will say there isnt really any point in going to court as you are allowing access, Your ex may try and get a little more access and this can result in letters between laywers

It also looks good for you that he didnt attend mediation, It makes HIM look unreansonable

If he doesnt have parental responsability and you are fine with him having it then ask your lawyer to sort it out, My husband has parental responsability of his daughter and basically all in means is that he will be informed if god forbid my step daughter was in and accident, He can contact her school for information about attendance etc

Dont worry about SS if he does call them they may come and see you but if you are coping and the kids are safe then they wont get involved

Good luck and keep your chin up <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/biggrin.gif"/>
