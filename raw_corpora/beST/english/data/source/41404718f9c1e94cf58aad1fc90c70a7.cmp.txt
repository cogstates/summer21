RetiredGySgt, in a rather lazy fashion repeatedly points to The National Security Archive 's collection of 77 documents on the atomic bomb and end of world war 2 saying 'the proof is in there'. Rather like tossing a dictionary at a newspaper editor and saying 'here's tomorrow's front page story'.

So where in the comprehensive 77 lengthy sections could that magical, much sought-after golden fleece-like 'good reason' to consign the 350,000 civilian population of Hiroshima and the 250.000 civilian population of Nagasaki to the horrors of a nuclear blood bath be hiding?

Perhaps it was Document 29, where on 11 of July Foreign Minister Togo sent the following 'extremely urgent' message to Ambassador Sato:

"We are now secretly giving consideration to the termination of the war because of the pressing situation which confronts Japan both at home and abroad Therefore, when you have your interview with Molotov [ in accordance with previous instructions] you should not confine yourself to the objective of a rapprochement between Russia and Japan but should also sound him out on the extent to which it is possible to make use of Russia in ending the war."

and then on the same day:

".. Japan- as a proposal for ending the war and because of her concern for the establishment and maintenance of lasting peace - has absolutely no idea of annexing or holding the territories which she occupied during the war."

These Documents reveal many desperate attempts by Japans envoys to establish a surrender up to the very end and on August 5th (Document 52). All the while U.S. interceptors secretly listened in, and made Truman's office aware of the full content of these Japanese attempts yet they went ahead anyway, choosing to test one of each type of their new atomic devices, first Uranium, then Plutonium on the living Human guinea pigs; the old men, the helpless women and innocent children behind enemy lines, away from the theatre of war, away from where the soldiers were. America sneaked in, from a safe height and in cowards fashion dropped their devastating bombs on non combatants then ran away.

And as President Harry Truman ate his lunch on the Augusta with fellow mass murderers Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin, news of the bombing of Hiroshima came in. Jubilantly, he announced to the retinue of sailors around him..

"This is the Greatest thing in History!"

It has always bothered me that we bombed cities full of non-whites, but not Germany, where the Death Camps existed. Maybe the A-Bomb was not finished before VE Day. Maybe.

But the US confined Japanaese Americans to internment camps and did NOT do so as to Italian Americans or German Americans.

It seems to me there must have been a tremendous temptation to drop the A-Bomb SOMEPLACE, just to show the world what we had. Without using it in warfare, who would ever believe this gruesome weapon even existed?

All these things, together with the second bombing, have made me uneasy. I WANT to believe Truman's decisions were ethically defensible. His comments to those around him do not offend me. It's understandable that he wanted VJ Day at any cost.

But still the doubts persist -- that we bombed a couple of Asian cities and killed millions, instantly or later by radiation poisoning, because we COULD and not because we had no other choice.

I don't know what my Daddy saw or knew. I lost him when I was quite young, and like most WW II vets, he would never discuss what he'd been through. But my Mommy and Daddy were pinkos. They sympathesized with or actually joined the American Communist Party. I rather think if he'd been all good with Truman's decisions, Daddy would not have been such a radical after the war.

Over 5000 German Americans were arrested and confined, several thousand were not released until 1946.

Quartermass has not given opinion in that last post, namvet. He recited facts. Either he has the facts right or he doesn't.

If he's right, what use is it to go on pretending it was all good?

His facts SUPPORT what I told you. The Japanese simply offered to end the war in place. They would evacuate all territory captured after December 7 1941 and we would return all Territory held by them prior to Dec 7 1941. That simply was not going to happen. It is idiotic to think it would happen.

Once again we did not have a functioning A bomb to drop on Germany before she surrendered and to tell you the truth we had no need to do so, they were not unreasonable fools like the Japanese.

We did however FIREBOMB most of their cities killing hundreds of thousands of Civilians.

One of you is right and the other is wrong...on the facts.

Is there no good source document to go look-see who's right, namvet? Has there never been a proceeding in the Hague or any sort of international court?

how about documents on this. from the Truman library archives. there is no doc that says we offered or agreed to any surrender prior to the bombs. it was still unconditional surrender !!!!
