On the flip side, my mom owns her own in-home daycare and had a mom come in and BF her child in front of everyone with NO cover. My hubby and BIL were in the room and we were all talking when she completely lifted her shirt up, exposed EVERYTHING and went on to feed her 3 YEAR OLD little girl who was standing while feeding......That's a bit much for me. My hubby and BIL were so uncomfortable they left the room. I was even uncomfrotable with it.

And see that's what I was trying to express with what I said previously. It's not that breastfeeding is nasty or something that needs to be hidden, but it's the same reason we cover up while we're out in public. ETA - speaking of a similar situation as the above, not saying everyone should necessarily use a cover.

Well I don't think BFing has anything to do with modesty. It's shyness, or something on the mother's part that would make it 'embarassing' to her. That's not modesty, that's being a coward.

If you're truly concerned about modesty then you wouldn't feed in front of anyone because you don't think they should see your reproductive organs. Not because it's uncomfortable for YOU. If you feed in front of women then it's a double standard and you're kind of full of shit. Women can find breasts just as attractive and it still is exposing 'sexual' organs.

I do kinda wonder how many of you find it okay to wear shirts showing a good amount of cleavage but won't BF except under cover.

I show cleavage, so what. I don't let my whole boob show, but showing a little bit of cleavage isn't that big of a deal? :/ If Daniel wanted to walk around with no shirt on, be my guest, he wouldn't anyways because its not like hes the situation or anything...and i like that. <img src="http://www.thepregnancyforum.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

BF'ing is totally natural and as long as you're discreet, WHO CARES!!! If there's a bunch of males in the room, I'd find another place just to not make them uncomfortable. If it's women, friends etc, no prob just cover up, don't cover up whatever floats your boat. At a restaurant I would just use one of those cover ups they make and no one would even care or notice, which is what most of the mom's I know do.

On the flip side, my mom owns her own in-home daycare and had a mom come in and BF her child in front of everyone with NO cover. My hubby and BIL were in the room and we were all talking when she completely lifted her shirt up, exposed EVERYTHING and went on to feed her 3 YEAR OLD little girl who was standing while feeding......That's a bit much for me. My hubby and BIL were so uncomfortable they left the room. I was even uncomfrotable with it. There was also another mom who BF her 5 YEAR OLD before she'd leave at daycare we ran at a health club. She just whipped it out and he'd suck away...I think they're should be an age limit on BF when they are doing it at that age. Give them regular milk or a juice box!

I have a close friend who BF's and when it's just her she'll whip it out and feed her little kiddo. No big deal, it's just us and I have no problems with it. My sis does the same thing. Some people just take it too far sometimes.

My Aunt breastfed all 3 of her babies and she whipped a boob out while we were at Hurrican Harbor (A HUGE water park by Six Flags here in Texas) and I was only 13 at the time. I kind of freaked out and left.

Granted, she is a BIG woman, and had very very large bazoongas! <img src="http://www.thepregnancyforum.com/images/smilies/eek.gif"/> But hey, to each their own.... Personally I plan on stopping BF'ing when my kid is old enough to say "Mommy milk." Which should be roughly 2 yrs I guess.

5 years seems a little.....strange. lol
