Elaine Kaplan

An out lesbian has been confirmed as a judge of the United States Court of Federal Claims, according to the official website of the U.S. Senate.

The Senate confirmed Elaine Kaplan by a vote of 64-35 at 12:03 p.m. today. Kaplan, who currently is the acting director of the United States Office of Personnel Management, had been nominated for the position by President Barack Obama in March.

She will serve a 15-year term in this judgeship, where she will hear monetary claims against the federal government.

"These nominees have dedicated their careers to serving the public good," said Obama after nominating Kaplan as well as Patricia Campbell-Smith, reported the Human Rights Campaign. "And in so doing, they have displayed an unyielding commitment to justice and integrity. I am confident that they will serve the American people well from the Court of Federal Claims, and I am honored to nominate them today."
