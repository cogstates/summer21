Why would governments and companies in certain countries sell arms to an offensive country when they attack a country they dislike but then attack that country when it attacks a country they do like this is double standards!

I am talking about the Iraq before and during the Gulf War. Iraq attacked Iran then governments were happy to sell weapons to Iraq including UK, France, US, West Germany, Italy, China and Soviet Union. Some of them were even selling to both sides such as US, Soviet Union and China. A small minority sold only to Iran these were North Korea and surprizingly Israel according to Israel (although Iran denies this).

Why would all these countries be happy for Iraq to go on the war path and to fund both all sides of the war yet go after Iraq when it starts on Kuwait (although they left Saddam in power).

My thoughts are that governments simply let their private arms companies make a bit of cash off the war like they usually do. They used their puppet governments of the Shah and Saddam to control the countries to counter Soviet influence in the region. When the Islamic revolution happened the US lost all their influence over the nation so after Iraq began their attempted invasion they happily cast a blind eye in order to regain influence. Then when they saw Saddam invading country they already had influence in Kuwait they finally took action although they left him in power as the Soviets were still there and wouldn't want Iraq to become communist.

Then 12 years later there is no longer a Soviet union but they notice a strengthening Iran that is a potential threat to their ally Israel so when some they get some 'evidence' of Iraq with nuclear material from a known unreliable source via MI6 they jump with joy to invade it. It is a win win for their publicity they either take out evil dictator Saddam or they stop Iraq getting nukes. Then they build up their bases in Iraq and fund a new government to counter the threat of Iran as they lost all influence upon Iraq when they stopped them in the first gulf war.

These wars are just ways to prevent other nations gaining any sort of power whether it is directly or indirectly as well as make their arms companies some major money on the side. So if you still think the US and co are the just and honourable governments they claim to be why would they allow companies to fund two sides of a war? why would they go to war over an ideology? why would they only take action when a puppet state is invaded?

Because governments change every 4 years in most places and every government tends to pursue a different policy. Blair sold guns to Gaddafi and Cameron helped oust him, you can't look at it as if Cameron is bound or responsible for the actions of Blair

A countries actions shouldn't (and luckily don't) depend on moral standards. It is naive to think they should.

There are far more important political and economical reasons for military intervention or political sanctions.

I certainly don't, they're mostly hypocrites.

If only we could make the leaders look right into the eyes of every civilian they kill, maybe the fighting and wars would stop. Obviously I know it never will, but I can dream.
