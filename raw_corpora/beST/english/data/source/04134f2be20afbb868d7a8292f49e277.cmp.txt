I apologise in advance if there is something similar to this thread, but this is a topic that has interested me recently and would just like to hear your views on the matter.
I'm a British Pakistani, born and brought up in London, however I would say I am very much in touch with my roots and my views lean more towards the traditional and conservative side. Recently I watched a documentary by Saira Khan 'Don't tell my Mother I am in Pakistan', made a few years ago, yet a very interesting watch. I have been on holiday to Pakistan a fair amount of times, and have traveled throughout the country, so I thought I had a pretty accurate idea of the country as a whole and it's people. However, after watching the documentary and various other programs and films on Pakistan I am absolutely shocked. I may be wrong when I say this, but was Pakistan not founded as a Muslim state, yet only 64 years on and I don't think the country matches the vision it was initially created with. It seems that the higher class are obsessed with imitating and adopting western culture, in a sense it boosts their superiority complex. I actually find it shocking, that most families who moved to England in the 60's like my grandfather have managed to maintain that cultural pride and certain traditions that have been lost among certain groups of people in Pakistan. Drinking is a common practice with the upper class society and personally I find it quite upsetting, it seems as if Pakistan is moving in the opposite direction- the rich becoming more obsessed with western culture and the less well off being neglected further. Also whilst I'm on this topic, has anyone seen the film 'Slackistan' and what were your views?
Thank for reading my thoughts! <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

So, you want to protect or retain a culture, which sanctifies the practices of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor_killing">honour killing</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bride_burning">bride burning</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_throwing">acid throwing</a>, the abominable practice of <a href="http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/7523/female-genital-mutilation-in-pakistan-and-beyond/">female genital mutilation</a>, and <a href="http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/8967/prostitution-in-the-land-of-the-pure/">sexual abuse</a> ?

Not to forget the tradition of <a href="http://www.dawn.com/2011/09/07/bartered-in-marriage-the-bride-exchange-in-rural-pakistan.html">Barter marriages</a>, young girls forcefully married to much older men, and some in extreme cases married to Quran itself! <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/shock.gif" alt=":shock:"/>

One wonders why Pakistan is the <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/06/15/idINIndia-57704120110615">world's third most dangerous country for women</a> to live in?

Yet you're worried about upper classes choosing to indulge in a bit of harmless fun? <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt=":rolleyes:"/> As a Pakistani, I welcome western influence on our culture - it might help Pakistan to become a more civilized society.

Edit: I watched that Saira Khan's documentary you're referring to a few months ago. I would like to know what you found so offensive? She was sympathetic to the plight of transgender community in Pakistan - isn't that a positive thing? <img src="images/smilies/s-smilie.gif"/>

Liberalization is moving in the OPPOSITE direction?

Personally, any nation's judiciary system that is in anyway influenced by objective morality scriptures and superstition has no place in the 21st century. While I can understand your sentiment that is undesirable for tradition to be dismantled, ever since the fall of the wall in 1989, Liberal democratic values have spread (End of History, Fukuyama, 1992) and that does not preclude (just yet) the sovereign states whom are conformed to Islamic teachings as their rule of law.

Western culture gives people individuality and lets them choose whether to follow conservatism or choose their own destiny and the right to enjoy any liberties they desire (as long as it doesn't harm anybody else). I think it is the right direction that Western culture (unforced) is spreading, it gives a common ground for different cultures to interact, promotes tolerance and allows people to pick their own way of life. I don't see that being a problem.

Sorry, in hindsight I really do think I should have written the post a little better. I do not think our culture is perfect, there are many traditions that I do believe in at all and am strongly against, yet I do think that the moral values taught through culture and religion should definitely be retained. Following your point, I think that to an extent in the 21st century we require a society based on basic morals and values, I feel that these are the foundations.
I agree with you in the sense that western culture does encourage individuality, definitely! It has helped to shape the country, allowed women to have more rights and freedom. I mean now in Pakistan, it is common for women to work and I totally support this. Women should have as much right as any man. I think the next step forward in Pakistan is adopting the western idea of equality, which is severely lacking there.

It has a lot to do with the government, when the politicians are corrupt, there is little hope for the country. What Pakistan needs is a strong leader, focused on the well-being of it's people rather than power and money.
