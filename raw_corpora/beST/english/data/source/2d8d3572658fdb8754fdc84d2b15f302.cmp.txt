OH, so you are talking about the Welfare Queen that Reagan talked about that didn't really exist. Are we going to talk about unicorns next? Lepruchauns?

The Unemployment rate isn't that important. a 5% unemployment rate where everyone has McJobs isn't an improvement. I would much rather have the Clinton UE of 3.9% where you could throw out a resume and get a better paying job in a month that you barely qualified for than the 6.3% UE of Bush where you couldn't get a job you totally qualified for because you were competing against 40 other guys who were just as qualifed.

Offshoring replaced good paying manufacturing jobs with service McJobs. That was NOT an improvement, guy. Bloodletting is not a valid medical treatment, either. We send out 500 billion in wealth every year to other countries, that's not a good thing.

I am talking about generations of unemployed and unemployable people. Don't tell me they dont exist. You ought to know better.
Your comparison of the Bush years with the Clinton years is a joke. But I have effectively refuted your point: off shoring was going like crazy during hte Bush years and there was more manufacturing going on here and less unemployment.
I am sorry you cannot compete against guys more qualified than you. Night school maybe?

Vocational School. Trade School. Charter Schools work Miracles in some of the most impoverished areas of NYC. Unfortunately the Teachers Union's work to discredit them. Bottom line good study habits happen best when the kids are reached earlier on.

The malaise and entitlement of generational poverty has to be overcome first. And that's a tall order.

Clearly we need the poor to have money in their pockets so they can buy our goods and services.

And the rich use them to build their empires.

When did a poor person ever create a job? Last time he had money in his pockets. Before Bush took office. That's when.

In spite of the fact that this argument has been made numerous times here....we never seem to see any of the dug-in nutters acknowledge the truth in it.

When lots of people have money to buy necessities AND a few bucks to spend on wants AND a few bucks to save and invest..........................we all benefit. I sure wish that every McDonalds employee had a the cash to remodel their kitchen.

And despite the fact that their way didn't work, won't work, isn't going to work, they will never admit it. Look at how bad things were in 2008 and they basically voted for another 4 years of Bush. That's how brainwashed they are.

Thank God for the 99%ers' They seem to understand the system is rigged. I think most of them are going to vote for Obama again. The economy is getting better and Mitt is against them.

But man are a lot of middle class and even poor Americans brainwashed. I've narrowed it down to God, Gays and Guns. Flat out ignorants. Racist, Stubborness. Or they even might actually possess a gene that you and I don't have. Greed, bitter, always think somoenes out to get theirs. Not realizing they benefit too when we are all in this together.

And I know a lot of very good people who are voting Republican. They have been brainwashed by Fox and/or Rush. But again, they must have the gene that makes them seseptable to it, because all I get from watching Fox is mad.

People have been brainwashed. Now they are set in their ways. All we can do is hope they wake up or stop voting.
