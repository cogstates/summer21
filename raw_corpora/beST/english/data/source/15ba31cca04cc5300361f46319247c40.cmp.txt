Newt has a high unlikablitity quotient in my opinion. I just don't think we are going to elect someone we dont' fundamentally like. The President has to connect a "warm fuzzy" to people on some level. Clinton and W had a certain rascal type quality. And, something about Obama seems likeable even if you hate his policies. And, that is something needed to become President. Romney has a "Father Knows Best" aura around him so i don't think people dislike him. But, Newt comes across as arrogant, mean, and just nasty at times and i don't think he can over come that with Happy talk.

I am feeling very jealous of TM and Rdean because they can post a stupid and get 57 instant responses.

Come on folks, doesn't anyone have anything to say to this?

Your post is intelligently and reasonably stated. The facts about Clinton's foibles are accepted by most reasonable people. Maybe a little long for the likes of TM and Rdean, because I would think they would take issue with the thrust of some of the content. Seems you have to flame people to get their attention.
Good post Baruch.

The double standard allows democrats to ignore what they call "family values" because the democrat party does not promote or endorse morality. It's a great advantage for a democrat candidate to be immune to allegations of improper conduct while accusing republicans.

In the great debate over Newt and his love life, people keep bringing up the case of Clinton.

I believe this to be a case of apples and oranges. Clinton was in trouble for suborning perjury in a civil rights case where he was the defendant. That was also about a blow job, of course. He insisted one of the workers at the DMV give him one and she turned him down and got fired because of that.

However during the clinton debate the Democrats kept going on and on about the blow job. Fundamentally, I think it squicked everyone out to the point they wanted the story over. Plus there was the whole april -december aspect of Monica's mental maturity and age. Normal people found the whole thing beyond disgusting.

Presidential philandering is not new. And where he sticks his wand can be a matter of national importance. John and Robert Kennedy both shared the same girlfriend with Sam Giacanna. This, had we be wiling to talk about it seriously at the time, would have been legitimate cause for concern. The face that James Buchanan was effectively the wife of Alabama Senator King also should have got a bit more scrutiny in the run up to the Civll war.

But over the years we have sort of thrown a blanket over Presidential private lives. For good or ill. President Cleveland's daughter Ruth was an issue in the campaign, but it did his opponents no good because he was busy discussing tariffs and the depredations of the railroads. He never did marry Ruth's mother.

The relationships between Roosevelt and Eleanor and whomever are a matter of titillation but no historical relevance. Eisenhower and Summersby is ignored again because it is pointless and squicky.

The fact that Nixon and Carter were uxorious did not make them good presidents. Pat Nixon's love for Dick didn't solve the Watergate issue, nor did Roselyn's affection for Jimmy reduce the inflation rate. Clinton's tomcatting didn't make him a failure.

So what does this have to do with Newt? The basic issues here are trust, intelligence, national security and economic recovery.

Newt's relations with women are at best reprehensible. If it were a matter of him vs someone equally intelligent and less of a cad I would gleefully go for the other option.

however, there is no drama that he was involved with Anna Chapman or any other honey pot involved with Russian or US mafias. He does have lots of really interesting ideas about the economy and the US's relations with the rest of the world that are worth listening to. (But his actual record vis a vis Israel and the Global Warming hoax show he also has pretty bad ideas as well)

So on balance, I have to say that given a choice between Romney and Romney care and Newt and his affection for all his weird baggage with PBS, Global Warming, playing footsie with various flaky arab regimes... I prefer Santorum. But Newt's conjugal craziness is not part of my decision tree.

I for one am getting weary of so called "dirt" being dug up on candidates private sexual lives from one decade ago let alone many decades ago.

And it's actually becoming pitiful to watch the political press become TMZ with old bitter women who have an axe to grind.
