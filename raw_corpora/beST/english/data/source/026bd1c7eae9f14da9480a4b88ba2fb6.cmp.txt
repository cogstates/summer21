than why the outrage over the Mosque at Ground Zero?

For the same reason the local Glock dealer would not open up a store in the same strip mall where 20 people got shot, 6 killed.

It's the decent and respectful thing to do.

So what does it then say about Palin's having just accepted an invitation to speak at a GUN SHOW immediately AFTER the AZ shootings?

That she has NO DECENCY AND RESPECT?

</quote>

Was the Gun show at the strip mall where the shootings occurred? Was it even in the same city? How about State?

Brilliant question, geauxtohell.

This theory demands that we buy into the theory that the 9-11 perps were just nutters and in no way were they motivated by the hatemonging they were exposed to, right?

That theory makes about as much sense (read none) as the theory that this perp killed the politician for no reason other than he was crazy, I suppose.

You're right... he may have had a wedgy

The night before the rampage, authorities say, Mr. Loughner, 22, dropped off at a drugstore a roll of 35-millimeter film containing images he had shot of himself posing with a Glock semiautomatic pistol while wearing a red G-string

Attempting to assign a motive to this nutbag is just silly.

He is saying that the right blames crimes committed by Muslims on Islamic rhetoric while claiming that "conservative" rhetoric has no effect on anyone.

I know.

And it's still bogus for two reasons.

1) Nobody says conservative rhetoric has no effect on anyone. In fact, it's desired effect is to influence how people vote and it does an ok job in that regard.

2) To compare any American political rhetoric, no matter how allegedly 'violent,' to the edicts issued by OBL and other Islamic terrorist leaders is about as fucking retarded as it gets.

There is absolutely no evidence that supports OBL or terrorists being connected to the mosque in question.

Use a ladder next time and climb out of the tree instead of falling on your head.

You are somehow equating the religion of a set of perpertators to a henous crime...that seem right to you, in the land of the free?

What part of the reality that Muslim terrorists USE their religion to justify their terror, murder and mayhem, don't you grasp?

And what part of of the reality that christians use their religion to justify their terror, murder and mayhem don't you grasp?

I didn't say there was.

Can explain how you connect the ground zero mosque and violent crimes committed by Muslim terrorists? I don't believe there is one but you seem feel differently about it.
