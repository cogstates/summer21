I was born and raised in Scioto County Ohio on a large farm in a very rural area near the Shawnee State Forest and do not recall any sightings. All of us boys roamed the woods both hunting and just for fun; in the winter with the snow on a favorite game was to let someone have a 10 minute head start and then track him. We never saw BF tracks.

In no way was I relating bear sightings to bf sightings. I was just commenting on Kitakaze's question "Where are bears?" My family has spent upteen thousand hours in Washington county woods and no bf there either. Or bear.
I like to hear about species returning to areas and I know many interested in "bf like" stuff do to.

WGBH,
I have an acerbic tone, I admit. (three strokes has interfered with my brains
checks and balances, so to speak, among other things). I apologize. But what I have said I stand behind.

What about Archangels proposal?

So nothing solid regarding cougars (though there are bobcats which people could mistake for cougars). As for the wolves, how reliable is that information you have regarding the shot dead animals? If confirmed that would be an example of an extirpated species returning to an area it once inhabited. I think you might agree this is a very far cry from massive undiscovered wood apes loping about Salt Fork State Park tossing rocks over by where the pavilion is, would you not?

I have heard the same from many friends who live there in Ohio. There are not that many bear sightings. We see lots of bear here in VA and in NC. When I went to PA we saw bears everywhere.

No worries and no need to apologize.

What was archangels proposal? I guess I need to scroll up and read it. Edit: I scrolled up about 4 pages and could not find it.

It was shown on the page just before this one. Here it is again:

Actually, just to clarify my position I have no idea what he smelled and don't want to say that it might've emanated from a bear.
I just feel that a physical source of odour cannot be ruled out as less likely than a hallucinated one.

I do have to ask for some clarification from someone who knows the area in question, the swamps I've been to here in Australia all smell bloody awful for the most part does the one in question have a similar sort of odour?

As I understand it the odour that occurs in swamps can be attributed to the rotting vegetation and animals, coupled with the moistness of the area.
The rotting process can lead to build ups of noxious smelling gases, especially if trapped under the usual layer of mud that is in a swamp.

If expelled this could create a small pocket of less oxygenated air, which could potentially have a foul smell (ie swamp gas).

The lack of oxygen in the area could bring on some of the symptoms that WGBH described (ie nausea etc) and if he was feeling faint enough it's also possible that he may have started to hallucinate things.

It could also explain why the rest of the group did not smell anything by the time they got back, it had dissipated.

Note:
I'm not claiming this is what happened, nor that it's even likely just that it might be another possible explanation.

Ah, I missed that, I must have been hallucinating. <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/biggrin.gif"/> Thanks for that Kit.

We were not in the swamp proper but the property was near the border. Nevertheless, The smell did have a bit of that swampy methane odor mixed in with the wet dog,rotting flesh smell.

Did I smell swamp gas and hallucinate? I would answer that the same way I have the other theory's submitted. Anything is possible, but I find it unlikely. I will admit that it is more likely then a sleep or brain disorder. I guess this is another thing I ask the park officials if I can ever get down there. We are getting swamped (pun intended) at work and it is hard for me to get away.
