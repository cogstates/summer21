<post id="p8" author="misterhighwasted" datetime="2015-04-09T20:12:00">
29. I just added another one to Ignore. They can talk to each other.

They have absolutely nothing of importance to say about Sec Hillary, from here on.

Everything about Hillary I read or post will be right here in the Hillary Room where it belongs.
They have nothing constructive to add anyway so they have no place on my DU Screen.
POOF They're Gone!!!

What a great exciting year we will have.
And it starts this Sunday.

God speed Hillary, see you in the Oval Office 2016

28. Wishful thinking.
</post>
<post id="p24" author="misterhighwasted" datetime="2015-04-09T19:11:00">
17. She will get her message out thru Social Media &amp; her tours.

She can get her actual message to millions directly via social media rather having her agenda filtered &amp; opined by MSM.
Her Team of savvy professionals will handle her campaign as it should be.
What people hear will be her own words. Not the RW owned media's version.
</post>
<post id="p25" author="hrmjustin" datetime="2015-04-09T19:12:00">
18. This is smart. She learned from the 2008 mistakes.
</post>
<post id="p26" author="OKNancy" datetime="2015-04-09T19:26:00">
19. Can you imagine the excitement if this happens?

20. I don't think the gop can beat a Hillary/Castro ticket.
</post>
<post id="p28" author="misterhighwasted" datetime="2015-04-09T20:19:00">
30. Clinton/Castro would blow up Jeb's dream of aligning with the Hispanic voters.

I love Castro for everything he represents.
So will the 2016 voters.

32. I checked out a related thread

in GD not too long ago. There were a few posters who expressed a lack of enthusiasm for the announcement, yet they bothered to view (and comment) on the page. It's stupid.

<post id="p34" author="hrmjustin" datetime="2015-04-09T21:36:00">
33. They know thwt they likely can not stop her and they are frustrated by it.

35. Business Insider: Rubio is to announce this weekend, however he will be overshadowed in the media by

Hillary Clinton. Also saying Rubio will not enjoy the benefit of free press that others like Rand &amp; Cruz had at their Pres race announcement.
Poor Marco. A day late &amp; a dollar short.
Overshadowed again.
