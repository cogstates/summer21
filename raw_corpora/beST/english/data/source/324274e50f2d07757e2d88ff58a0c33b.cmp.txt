I used to skate to the store or for exercise nearly every day before I moved to Madison--from a place where I could roll out the door with my skates on knowing I'd find a safe and efficient route to just about anywhere. The paving there had less texture and was much more even--I guess because it never froze and traction was hardly an issue either. I was excited to find and to skate the Military Ridge trail segment from Verona to the end of the fee/permit zone around McKee and Verona Rd--which has a nice surface. Does anyone know anyplace else? I've skated the shoreline from around Olin Park to Monono Terrace and up to the capitol via the bike elevator, as well as beyond Monono Terrace to East of the Isthmus--more or less according to a map the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/rollergath/MCR/">Mad City Rollers</a> have online, although the site seems to have been left dormant for awhile. But only the shoreline around the Terrace itself was really my idea of skate-friendly. Where do other people like to skate?

I was one of the founders of Mad City Rollers 10 years ago, and Ron Dennis and I switched off on running the club, until we both got tired of it, and sort of took up other hobbies. I'm out in CA all summer now that I'm a teacher, so I'm not going to do anything with the club anymore.

You can't be too picky about the pavement you're skating on, and the various bike/pedestrian/skate paths around Madison are plenty smooth enough for some good distance skating. If you really want to do a good number of miles, you can do the Capital City Trail south of Madison, up the lakeshore path, over the Central Isthmus path to Camp Randall, then down the Southwest Bike Path to where it connects with the Capital City trail, near the Allied/Dunn's Marsh neighborhood. I think the entire loop is around 18 miles. You'll need a trail permit to do the Cap City trail, but it's very much worth it.

We used to have a good Friday Night Skate group that did the 10 mile route described on the website, but the group got smaller and smaller. Ron Dennis realized that the fitness/speed skaters were much more committed, and likely to show up, so he ran speed workouts for the last few years, with great success.

We also gave beginner skate lessons on Monday evenings, in the parking lot at Machinery Row, but it sounds like you know what you're doing. Please wear your helmet whenever you skate!
