Maybe you're onto something. I was thinking the Marines should absorb the Air Force, but then we don't need you so it would be only an act of charity. We could pawn you off on the Navy but they don't need you either.

Matter of fact seems everybody can do their own flying AND fighting on the ground but you powderpuffs.

Probably be best if we divvy up your assets among the 3 useful services and just send y'all home since you couldn't pass a PFT and the sight of an actual bayonet would make you faint.

Or perhaps y'all should be re-absorbed back into the Army where you came from. You know... back when the USAAF was worth a fuck?

That's cold, Gunny. My service was not in vain.

I maintained nuclear missiles, something that keeps the cockroaches from fucking with us.

Plus, I can fold hospital corners like a fucking PRO.

Me, too.

I hand wash and fold laundry like a demon on steroids, too.

Hell the NAV even showed me how to hang up my wash on a clothes line with little pieces of rope.

Now there's some skills I can take to the bank, eh?

I'm like totally qualified to run a pre-industrial laundry service.

And remember, the motto of the editecian laundry service, you pampered hopelessly non-domestic Letherheads, Dogs and Flyboys...

No tickee? No forking washee, and that's no shit.

Ha, that washing woman is the daughter of a bar girl from olongapo who migrated to kinville. The washing woman's daughter now runs a mojo house.

I love you no shit, now buy your own fucking drink.

All the men in my family have always been Marines. And all of them are some hard motherf'ers. I've never known an Army guy that even came close. For my tax dollars I think we should expand the Marines and take the funding necessary from the Army. No need for a long term mission if everyone is dead.

I have a brother in Iraq right now. At night when I say my prayers I make sure to include the Iraqis because I know what he's capable of.

Don't get all sensitive on me now. You know WHO the remark was directed to and why. I grew up in the Air Force. My father is a retired Chief, and my grandfather (his father) a retired Army SgtMaj. I have nothing but respect for the other services.

But when it's time to play the interservice rivalry shit-talking game, and it's aimed MY way, I'm returning fire.

<img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> Cool logic, just because you never met any so called "hard motherf'ers" in the Army it does not mean they fail to exsist. But of course coming from a family of Marines I will exscuse your bias opinion.

Well, we could discuss the Army's judgement. Both of my brothers are Army zeroes. That's almost like being in the real Army, isn't it? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

One has to wonder just WHAT THE HELL the Army was thinking with THAT dynamic duo; especially, the West Point grad.

Well I do suspect that the siblings are a bit jealous of the Gunny being, well, a Gunny. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_whistle.gif"/>

Yeah, like being a sailor is almost like being a Marine! All you swabbies look the same to me!

Sorry, couldn't resist.

On a side note, for those of you who think there are no hardcore Army folks, you need to quit hanging out with the REMFs!
