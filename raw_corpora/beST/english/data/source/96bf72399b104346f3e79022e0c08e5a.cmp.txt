Definitely a back to the future picture show. Ah, all those desirable wonders of the Eighth Century, AD, anyway. No polio vaccines, no antibiotics, no automobiles, no radio, no television, just a man and his goats communing together.
Afghanistan in the 50's and 60's.

The Soviets lost over 11,000 trucks in Afghanistan.
Maybe with that number you can grasp the destruction that went place there.
Off course, you didn't mentioned that part at all.

Lordy, lordy. Tell me, you dumb ****s, is Iraq more free now than before we invaded? What is the state of the Christians there? How about women's rights? Sharia law more prevelant or less prevelant that before we invaded?

Afghantistan is a loss. There has never been anybody that could stay there any amount of time as an occupier. They all ended up like the British and Soviets, bled dry. And if we fail to withdraw, that will be our fate also.

After 9-11, we should have gone in, taken out Bin Laden, and got the hell out of there. Never, never should have invaded Iraq. All done on the basis of lies and stupidity.
