This morning I was watching "Good Day New York" on Channel 5, which is part of the FOX network. The co-host were interviewing a guy who is part of the on-going occupation of Wall St., and were (of course) repeating the media standard line by questioning the man as to why there is no set goals or leadership to advocate such goals. During his response, the man pointed out that it's about all types of people pointing out that nothing is being done about the economic inequality and subsequent crimes perpetrated by Wall St./banking giants (individuals and corporations)....and that you had leaders from various backgrounds join in. He stated that Al Sharpton "a self made man from the streets like me" was joining.....at which time co-host Greg Kelly interjected (twice) that like Al Sharpton, Rupert Murdoch is a self made man.

<img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/confused.gif"/> Come again?

Rupert Murdoch INHERITED HIS FATHER'S OWNERSHIP OF TWO NEWSPAPERS IN THE U.K. (Australia). He did NOT start out in the copy room of some local city paper and work his way up to mogul.

Al Sharpton grew up doing the preacher circuit for his particular brand of religion. Big difference.

I saw this as just another Fox flunkie pushing the "class warfare" line that's heard from the neocon/teabagger pundits in the media. By trying to equate Murdoch as a successful "every man", co-host Greg Kelly pushes the subliminal context that the Wall St. protesters are just "jealous" of "successful people".

Typical Fox BS....but not unexpected.

What the hell does that bolded part mean? Anybody?

I forgot how willfully ignorant and purposely obtuse you can be, Cali-Girl. Let me dumb it down for you: Murdoch was born into the American equivalent of upper middle-class....the next best thing to being "old money". So he had ADVANTAGES from birth...he did NOT have to work his way up the ladder or beat his brains to get a scholarship. So the comparison to Sharpton as a "self made man" is a crock. Got that, bunky?

Still waiting for TackyLiberal to explain what 'in the UK (Australia)' means. Australia is not in the UK.

I stand corrected. Now, do YOU have the cojones to deal with the FACTS that back up my opening posts point regarding the idiotic comparison of Murdoch to Sharpton as "self made men"?

I'm a details person.... factually accurate details. Lesson: The United Kingdom: the countries of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Great Britain: the countries of England, Scotland and Wales. Not rocket science..... or maybe it is. It seems many Americans are incapable of grasping that fairly straightforward fact.

Now, to address your "point". Murdoch inherited two fairly successful newspapers and turned them into a global media empire. So, he is a 'self made man', if you want to quibble over that, fine. Personally, I don't give a shit about Murdoch or Sharpton's 'success'.... I have zero respect for either.

How's that obsession working for ya champ?

If you are addressing me, please explain how telling the truth and pointing out lies RE: Fox News and the Wall St. occupation an "obsession"? Unless you can prove me wrong, it would seem that YOU are obsessed with just being contrary to anything I post. Carry on.

Anyone reading your manic, endlessly repetitive, one-note screeching on this thread alone can see the obsessive rantings of a defective mind at work.

The ows are just a bunch of spoiled kids that want great pay w/o the education or effort it takes to get it.

None of them are taking personal responsibility, just blaming Wall St.

I'd be embarrassed to have anyone in my family involved in this non-sense.
