A matter of weeks after screwing the pooch in Iraq Obama is doing what I knew he would do even before he was elected. Bush just spent 7 years rebuilding the military and Obama like the liberal he is decimates it. If a Republican wins in November the cycle will repeat itself.

Obama wants us to think the threats are gone. Actually Iran is proving they're worse. However, Obama has a plan. Gut the military to pay for his social programs and then hope nobody starts anything with whatever resources we have left.

Today we were told not to talk about our opinions on this matter while at work. Sounds like the orders we received when I was still on a team. Don't bad-mouth the ignorant SOB or face charges.

Screw it.

An American and a N Korean are sitting in this bar and the the American turns to the guy and asks "Kim Jong Il's son is now your leader" he says sarcasticly. "How can you put someone with zero leadership expirience in charge of your military??"

The N Korean turns to him and says with a grin "You should talk......at least our President isn't afraid of Victory".

I don't suppose it occured to you to provide us with some empirical evidence to support this charge of yours, did it?

I wrote on here when Panetta was named SECDEF that he was sent there to dismantle the place. Military end-strength goes way down during Democrat administrations. No surprise here. This time it will be worse. They are going after pay, retirement, and health care benefits. Not cool Mr. Prez.

Remember the Bush budget that Cut money to the VA?
During his wars while the wounded were still rolling in.

</quote>

I do remember.

I have no problems with the increased funding for the VA, TBI treatment, PTSD, veteran unemployment initiatives, and other such efforts by the current administration. I also have applauded the First Lady and Dr. Jill Biden for their pro-miltary platform.

My comments are concerning the maintenence of a strong military and the career designated personnel that operate it. I've lived throught the bad years and the good ones and prefer the good ones. I'm not whining about losing my benefits as they can't touch my monthly retirement check except for the annual COLA. They can and probably will mess with my health care, although I don't mind a modest increase in premiums.

VA funding and DOD monies come from different pots.

Most of the expense of the rebuild went to new equipment, new armored vehicles, fuel for ships and planes, upgrades on garrison facilities.

Now all of that will go to waste. Civilian job positions aren't being filled. New facilities needing maintainance are already falling into decay. There is only so much fat you can trim from an already lean fighting force. But Obama thinks he can bullshit us into thinking he'll make the military better. He just wants something smaller and less expensive. He wants to turn us into a second-rate world power. None of his flowery words will prevent that.

Are you fucking serious? "Lean"?

We spend more money on our Military than the next 10 largest militaries combined.

</quote>

Thats because of our cost of living expenses. We pay our troops and civilian employees/contractors a hell of a lot more than other countries. All the equipment it uses is much more expensive as well since most of it is manufactured here. Yet many countries have far a bigger military (troop size) than the US.

My son is a Sgt in the Army, Ft Bragg. We spent Christmas with him and his family, and he talked about Obama wanting to cut their pay. He's been to Iraq 3 times, and now training in PsyOps. They should NEVER cut the pay of our military. They risk their lives for US....
Islam want's our country to die....and our great leader want's it too.

</quote>

of course Odumber wants to cut the pay or make people get out with 15 years in so they do not get their retirement or medical benefits they worked so hard for. So he has money for his pet projects and the people in Washington get their pay raises

Yeah thats true we do spend more than the next 10 largest militaries combined. But If I am not mistaken we protect far more interests and humanitarian aid is included in the DOD budget. Also at a time where soldiers are averaging multiple deployments in their first 5 years I dont think a troop reduction is really called for. Maybe a war reduction first then we can talk about cutting troops.

But positioning another battle fleet by Iran while the tentative outcasting of US troops by Iraq has left over 23000 soldiers in Kuwait plus more in neighboring countries because nobody believes we will be gone long does not signal a promising end to wars in the middle east. Why would we shift our views to asia ie china and russia when they pose no threat and our naval and air superiority are not in question?

I love it when Liberals claim they "care" about the military.

Fucking laughable.
