Actually, as an owner of a temporary placement agency (we are a business planning and human resources solutions firm in the NYC area), it does not actually work that way. We can not offer a temp a lower salary and then deny him/her unemployment if he/she rejects the assignment. It willbe a valid rebuttle and we would lose.

Furthermore, we would never want to alienate a good tempoorary employee with such an act. Maybe some of the smaller shops that try to maximize revenue at the cost of quality service do...but as someone in the industry for over two decades, 75% of that time as an owner, that is only successful for the short term. For your inventory (temps) is at a constant and constantly rotating in and out. You need to grow inventory to grow revenue.

What many people dont realize is we value our temps as much as we value our clients. We must perform superior customer service for all of them.

I never had any luck with the temp agencies, one time I got a voice mail from one of them saying they had a job for me. I called back, and the lady said sorry since you didn't answer we offered the job to the next person on the list who answered the phone, that didn't make any damn sense to me.

Part of our business is very time sensitive. We may get a call from a client saying that they need something and called another service as well..and the one who performs the quickest gets the order. We explain that to our tempos when they apply with us so they understand the importance of always being reachable..to the best oif their ability.

We have some temps that make great money with us. Great relationships. We give them bonuses this time a year. Last few years they werent overly impressive...but the appreciation was there...and returned with GREAT quality and a great representation of our firm.

I suggest you spread yourself out. It is a matter of establishing yourself with one who sees your differential...whatever it may be. Present yourself as confident, reliable, and willing to do whatever you can to represent them at the highest of levels.....dont make it like "I need to make money...or....im desperate...or....Im doing this only so unemployemtn sees I am looking for a job.

Instead, make it like you are an asset to them.....not that they are an asset to you.

You will find you are treated with great respect with that typoe of approach.

Just say, the topic is beyond your understanding and its all good.

Great move having government take over loans and reduce the payment. You will be paying longer and more interest. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_clap.gif"/> <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_clap.gif"/>

Beyond my understanding? My mom just retired. She was a teacher. She started out with shit pay..long hours and lots of long nights. She had to get her masters.

That and I've had a few friends that were college professors. One guy did it during his time searching for another radio producer gig. He taught one class and was done. Shit pay..

So yeah..I have first hand experience with it.

No, you had SECOND Hand experience.

You never actually were a teacher: This would have given you first hand experience.
