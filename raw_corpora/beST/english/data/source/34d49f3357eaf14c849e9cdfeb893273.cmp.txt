The Aldi customer who shot an armed robber in the store Monday won't face any criminal charges, prosecutors confirmed Friday. Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm said the law allows use of reasonable force in threatening situations, regardless of whether the shooter has a concealed weapons permit. "He disrupted an act that potentially exposed himself and others to great bodily harm," Chisholm said. Video footage from the store showed "he acted reasonably and in a controlled manner during the encounter," Chisholm said. The customer, Nazir Al-Mujaahid of Milwaukee, held a news conference to discuss the incident. Al-Mujaahid, 35, called it nothing to brag about, but that "sometimes you have to do what you have to do."

I remember reading comments not too long ago along the lines of "who needs to carry a gun in a grocery store?" and characterizing the CCW crowd as predominately a bunch of middle aged white guys. Can't wait to hear your takes on this story that you all been avoiding....

Over 200 views and a week and a half and not a single word from the critics of concealed carry. The cat has your collective tongues.

I'll toss this into the pot. How about this recent report by the Cato Institute called "Tough Targets: when criminals face armed resistance from citizens"

So sounds like this guy is the rightie equivalent of scooter boy...

<quote orig_author="TMFA">
At the news conference, Al-Mujaahid plugged his new website, ccwadvocates.com. It reads in part:

Learn from Real People like you and me, normal Ordinary Citizens that have awaken the spirit of personal responsibility and freedom that this country was founded upon!

Sign up to hear exclusively from the Man that stopped an Armed Robbery at a Milwaukee Aldi store. Many have called him a hero, we like to call him our brother!

Do you think he gives capital-lettered emphasis to "Real People" and "Ordinary Citizens" to convey to his conservative brethren that he's not, actually, a terrorist?

He fired six or seven shots from about 20 feet away, and hit the guy only twice, not injuring him seriously enough with those two shots to prevent him from fleeing. If this is the kind of marksmanship we can expect from concealed carriers, I'd say we're likely in for some collateral damage sooner or later.

I too am concerned about injury to bystanders, and I will continue to shop in places with no-weapons signs out front. One person with a gun is bad enough, two are worse not better.

I didn't reply to the original posting earlier because I thought we'd done this topic to death and I'd already made my opinions clear. To be specific: more guns make possible more gun errors and misuse, more domestic and accidental injuries (deaths) in the home, and more reliance on lethal force to solve problems that could be solved other ways.

I am not against shooting sports, marksmanship competition and practice, not against hunting, not against hobbyists who collect guns in a responsible way. I am not for a law that prevents people from keeping a gun in their home although I am for safety regulations especially where children are present. I am for licensing gun owners and making the names and addresses of license holders public with restrictions for people who have domestic violence concerns. I am for closing loopholes on trade show sales and similar loopholes. I believe a discussion on limiting the size of weapons civilians may possess is overdue.

I have read data that show concealed carry really doesn't have an effect one way or the other on crime (not accidents, crime) and I find this data the most compelling of all the variously-slanted stuff I've looked at.

And I would appreciate armed strangers not trying to manage my own personal safety. That's my business.

I don't intend to debate the whole issue again. Others have the right to their opinions as always, we don't have to agree, and there's little chance we ever will agree. I appreciate the chance to read the reasoning behind other viewpoints. It was an eye-opener.

I do appreciate the fact this shooter was not charged or detained, since he was acting within his understanding of the laws we have now. At the same time I don't think he's making our country stronger or better in any way --just more violent. At least he didn't choose to carry a great big gun that killed his target, who was not committing any capital crime. The guy(s) just wanted some money, which is probably covered by the store's insurance policy.

The store should install and use a floor safe and keep no more than a handful of change in the till. That would probably take care of repeat robbery attempts.

Agreed- no need to flog this deceased equine.
That said, I would caution against the attempted use of proof by anecdote here to prove the effectiveness and validity of the concealed carry laws.

You can't judge any issue using one example. And obviously, one "good" example still doesn't mean there should be open season for easy access to guns. Something D-man doesn't want to touch on.
