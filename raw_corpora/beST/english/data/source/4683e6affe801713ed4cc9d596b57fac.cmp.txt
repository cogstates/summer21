To find out all we have to do is ask Bernie Sanders and remember that Obama voted to the left of Sanders while in the Senate. God help us all if Obama ever got to appoint a liberal inflationist Fed Chairman.

obama DID appoint a fed chairman, youi blithering idiot. it was ben bernanke.... the same guy who worked for baby bush.

</quote>

Not really. No economic theory, more inflammatory name calling,... the use of metaphor in place of actual reasoning. You'd get along real well with Edward.

</quote>

of course everyone who has gotten as far as college knows that monetary stimulus is artifical and so creates mal-investment or bubbles that burst and cause recessions.

Nope.... quite a few of us got to and through college with the belief that monetary stimulus can provide a market for goods not yet produced..... that might be the reasoning for the "stimulus" part of the term "monetary stimulus".

Maybe try going to college and getting an economics degree before telling other people what "everybody who has gotten as far as college" knows? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_eh.gif"/>

You've taken Econ 101. I'm sure you're well versed in how shocks to monetary velocity that aren't offset, combined with nominal rigidities, can cause unnecessary recessions. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_eh.gif"/>

What it is is monetary central planner witch doctors, like those at the Fed, trying to tell us that you really can push strings.

</quote>

What the fuck are you talking about? You think Milton Friedman was a central planner witch doctor? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_eh.gif"/>

</quote>

He worked with and enabled some of the greatest authoritarian economic witch doctors of all time, including FDR....In fact one of Friedman's greatest regrets is that he foisted income tax withholding upon the nation.

Unlike some, I don't consider Friedman to be an economic demi-god.

</quote>

Friedman was a lead in the Chicago boys economics. Think south America...Pinochet, anyone. In other words, yes, Friedman was for central planning in monetary policy. Keynes was too. He himself said his theories would work best under authoritarian style governments. Shocker, he was right.

What most all modern day economists have in common is they believe in the control/plan model of economics. There is a concensus that economics is a hard science, when it is not. In order to prove their a priori values correct in mathematics, they must eventually succumb to controlling it all.

Economics is a human action and can not be quantified in natural science. Monetarists have some things right, but fall right into the planning trap.

The point is that since you're so keen on telling everybody to go to college and constantly informing us of your immense understanding of Econ 101, you should know better than anybody the basis you were asking for. No point in sucking eggs.
