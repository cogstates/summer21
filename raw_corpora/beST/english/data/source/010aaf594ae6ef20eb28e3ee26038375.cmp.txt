There are terrorist plots in the world, there just aren't terrorist plots like on "24."

Interesting. 24 didn't involve the Illuminati or aliens so according to some here, no conspiracies.

Seems like when someone shows a conspiracy that came true, others downplay as not sufficient, but things like MK-Ultra are as big a conspiracy theory as covering up alien encounters though the alien thing would be more significant.

As far as 9/11, what do some mean by conspiracy theory? That Bush did it? Then not so likely. That there was a 24-style cover-up because some conspiratorial elements or agents within the US government helped facilitate it?

Believe it or not, that's entirely feasible and entirely likely the powers that be would think this is not something we can have come out for the good of the nation and international affairs.

The existence of the Trilateral Commission, and of its project to halt radical political movements around the world and restore a kind of liberal-authoritarian stability, are documented facts of history. People might be forgiven in the 1970s for not having easy access to those documents, but today you can download them from the Commission's own web site so there's really no excuse.

Good point. How is it a conspiracy theory when the globalists openly call for world government.

On Waco, that is likely a good candidate for a legit, true conspiracy theory. it appears Reno Ok'ed or ordered spraying 9 times the lethal dosage for indoors of CS gas. Say what you want but that looks awfully close to murder and we're talking women and children here. Then, it looks like they also fired flash-bang devices which could easily set the "gas", really I think it's a powder, ablaze.

The facts suggest we all watched the federal government murder a bunch of people they didn't like. Even if you wanted to arrest Koresh and others and think they are killers, what excuse is there for killing the children?

The Courageous Italian Judge Felice Casson Was Responsible for the uncovering of "Gladio", the Italian Secret Army. Once Casson got the goods on those naughty naughty naughty little boys, then the Italian Prime Minister, Giulio Andreotti had to say something, confess in a sense. French President Francois Mitterrand back peddled furiously, but to no avail. He claimed, "When I arrived, I didn't have much left to dissolve. There only remained a few remnants, of which I learned the existence with some surprise because everyone had forgotten about them." To his credit, Andriotti called Mitterrand a coward in so many words for not being man enough if not to admit to his own complicity, which Mitterrand was, COMPLICITOUS, to at least to acknowledge the French Secret Army's robust activities. It all fell like a house of cards after that, and things lead right to our front door. After all, when it comes to NATO, we, the Americans, are the big Cheetos, ain't we?

So if you want a name LSSBB, there really is only one, the Great Italian judge, Felice Casson. The only guy both smart and brave enough to pull it off, expose the thing. Mind boggling really, one dude vs NATO! Incredibile!!!

I am an American citizen, 2nd generation, but ethnically and culturally Sicilian to some degree. I have many friends and a large family in Sicily. My friends and family revere Casson, as do many Italians, more for his courage than anything else. He is like Giovanni Falcone, the magistrate from Palermo who was so successful in prosecuting Mafia guys in the Maxi Trials, and got blown up for it along with his family. People love these guys, admire their courage.

One little Italian judge, showed NATO where they could stick it, right up their chicken _ _ _ _ butts. BEAUTIFUL!!!! BRAVO CASSON, BRAVO!!!!!!!

So there Greg, the NATO SECRET ARMY CONSPIRACY, a conspiracy that endured from 1945 through 1990, 45 years, with activities that included the murdering of innocent people, including children, to create fear in the hearts of Europeans so US military interests could park nukes in the Europeans' front yards. Pretty sick, ain't it?

And if you have any question, wondering if it really could be true, that heinously sick, it sounds so awful after all, don't hesitate to ask the Prime Minister of Italy, Andreotti. He'll confirm every atrocity for you, not to mention the President of France, Mitterrand, who said sure it went on, but he was late to the party so he won't be able to give you much in the way of details Greg..........

Hadn't heard of this. Thanks. Black ops are real, on-going and frequent or were for a long time (likely still but don't have any personal knowledge). They are often dismissed as conspiracy theories but such conspiracies are actually part of the fabric of history and something people need to accept and understand as not some wacko concept but how things get done sometimes.

It's a conspiracy theory because the press chose not to report on it, at a time when there weren't many ways to get around press silence. Also because mentioning the Commission and its goals did and still does carry the stigma of being judged a loon.
