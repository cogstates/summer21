I don't think alimony needs to keep the lesser earning spouse up in the "lifestyle to which they had become accustomed" indefinitely, but I do think that a lot of times spouses (usually women) put their careers on the back burner to support the breadwinning spouse. They miss out on income and earning potential/career growth/education while boosting those same things for their spouse. If they divorce, I think they deserve at least some money as compensation for what they gave up and to help them get back on their feet.

This is extremely well said.
Where I bristle at it is in situations where the decision for one spouse to stay home wasn't made together. Like, the wife unilaterally decides to stop working, or one spouse is completely unable to hold a job because s/he is immature, lazy, etc. I'm not sure what percentage of alimony payments go to people like this, but it makes me uncomfortable that it can happen and I judge the hell out of people like that that demand and accept alimony.

It's hard for a third party to say in retrospect whether it was a mutual decision or not, but if one spouse has been out of work for many years, it kind of seems like the courts have to assume the other spouse must have been okay with it for the marriage to have lasted so long.

How about this situation: 2 people get married as undergrads, graduate with their bachelor degrees, and make the decision that person A will work and support person B + kids while person B gets their graduate degree, then person B will work while person A gets their graduate degree. Person B asks for a divorce 6 months before getting their degree.

I'm coming from a different perspective but it isn't out of date.
I stopped practicing law when we had kids because one of our careers needed to go on the back burner. Since DH and I have been together and I stopped practicing, his income has more than doubled. Because I do 95% of the child rearing/cooking/cleaning he is able to do what he does.
I still work part time, but my earning potential is not even close to what it was before I stopped practicing if I ever needed to go back full-time.
We made this choice together and if he decides to run off with callista gingrich why should my standard of living suffer?

I can understand why it would be necessary in your situation, but I think it needs to have a defined time limit.
My perspective is coming from the fact that I'm divorced and my XH tried to milk me for everything I'm worth, even though he cheated on me. Michigan is a no-fault divorce state, so had we have been married longer or if he was laid off before our divorce, could have been responsible for spousal support.
I'm just a really independent and wouldn't need or want anyone supporting me. I would figure it out on my own.
