The potential cover-up is as bad as the original series of crimes IMO. That shouldn't just be swept under the rug while all the focus is on Sandusky and his behaviour.

Especially if the "pimping out to boosters" thing is true. We haven't heard anything on that in a few days.

It doesn't even make any sense. He says he stopped it...so where's the kid? Why didn't he bring the kid to a hospital, or stay with the kid until the police arrived? Why did he just send Sandusky on his merry way if he was present enough to intervene and stop it?

Also, I've heard reports that McQueary continued to work on children's charity events with Sandusky after he saw Sandusky raping that kid.

Let's say he did perjur himself. He did hollar or clock Sandusky and made sure he stopped raping the kid. But then he just left the just raped kid by himself and went off to his dad, not following up with the police or a hospital? How did he know Sandusky didn't go right back and continue raping him? He also continued to watch Sandusky interact with kids knowing he was a child rapist.

Even this new whitewashed version of events doesn't exactly reflect well on him.

Also, if he did lie to the grand jury, why would he tell that lie? There is NO motivation, no incentive, nothing to be gained, in telling the public that 'truth' but the grand jury that 'lie'.

It only makes rational and logical sense if he told the grand jury the truth, but is lying to the public.

They've started the pushback against McQueary's story:

That is interesting that the lawyer says he "thinks he may have found the kid in question and he says it never happened". Given how many kids Sandusky showered with, I wonder what makes him sure he's talking to the right one.

In any case, it doesn't much matter at the very end of the day. The indictment has testimony from six other kids who are adamant that things happened to them, so...

Really? In this case the original crimes were many magnitudes worse than the cover up IMO, and I frankly cannot fathom anyone saying or thinking otherwise. And certainly the cover up may have, and probably did allow for further incidents of abuse; but only in this aspect did the cover up even approach a somewhat similar level of seriousness to the multiple incidents of child rape and molestation.

If the individual said it did not happen (which is what <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/news/133872183.html">Amendola</a> is suggesting), the the 2002 incident should no longer be in the indictment. This might take McQueary out of the picture. I think that William Anderson was correct to question why the 2002 incident was part of the indictment, for reasons already given.

If the cover up did in fact facilitate more molestations, I suppose one could argue that it's all part of the same big predatory "event".

Not when the man publicly states he enjoys horsing around with young boys in the shower. There's not a glimmer of a resemblance to sex killer Knox or liar what's-her-face at Duke.

stilicho,

The three cases have little in common. However, KC Johnson, the premier blogger on the Duke lacrosse case, has some <a href="http://durhamwonderland.blogspot.com/2011/11/duke-penn-state.html">interesting observations</a> on the present one: "The university reappointed its president, and retained the same faculty hiring patterns that appeared to foster the rush-to-judgment attitude. It doesnÂ’t appear that even any of the faculty members were punished in any way for their dubious and in a few cases unethical conduct. Indeed, several Group of 88 members have been promoted to deanships" The Group of 88 signed a guilt-presuming statement that is full of dubious assertions and muddled thinking. MOO.
