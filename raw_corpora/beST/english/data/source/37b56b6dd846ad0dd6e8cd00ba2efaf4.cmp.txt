I have a favour to ask on behalf of <a href="http://hipforums.com/forums/member.php?u=4986">smartie.uk</a> who's currently in Angouleme on the first part of his travels through Europe. He's staying in a hostel and will be heading southwards on Tuesday (December 7), heading roughly in the direction of Spain across the Pyrennees.

He just texted me to ask if any of you French hipforumers are in the area and would be kind enough to give him a lift southwards? If anyone is willing to help out a fellow hipforumer please get in touch! <img src="http://www.hipforums.com/forums/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

Thankyou kindly!
