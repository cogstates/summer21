There is a certain logic to the idea that nations should keep their affairs internal and should not "meddle" in the domestic disputes of others. But does this include genocide or democide?

We saw how no one came to the aide of the Tutsi in Rwanda and that's why a million of them died in just a few weeks.
It seems that no one ever really cared about what was happening in Sudan.
The only nation seemingly interested in stopping the slaughter in Cambodia was the new communist government of Vietnam.
And what if Germany under Hitler didn't go around invading? Would anyone have stopped them from slaughtering their own in that case?

What are the solutions available to a world community when one nation decides to kill off a substantial portion of its own population?

If your own nation got a radical government and suddenly everyone of religious/ethnic group ______ are being led off to machine gun pits every day who would come to your aid? Would anyone bother? What if this nation has veto power in the UN?

The world is ill-designed in this sense.

To begin with, there is no such world police which would itself refrain from killing whom they want. USA is maybe close to this idea, but still their foreign politics are 100% about their own interests, not about anyone elseÂ´s interests or human rights. But anyway, USA is de facto a world police, and not the worst imaginable one.

So the other armed forces than USA occasionally commit human rights abuses of various degrees, sometimes murdering some or many or a huge amount of individuals.

The next problem is that this world police has issued arms ownership licenses so liberally that the world police does not control the world territory. Practically each nation is hostage of its armed forces. So whenever an armed force commits crimes against humanity, the starting point is always similar to a hostage crisis. The world police can send troops to surround the criminals, but there are no easy and clean options to go in without either of the armed forces massacring a lot of the hostages too.

So the end result is, all too often, that the world police simply turns a blind eye on human rights violations. The way the system is designed, not much more than this is practically possible.
