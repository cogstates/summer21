Ideally, insult their manhood until they took a swing at me then beat their asses in "self-defense."

I'm not so self-important that I need to carry a gun to protect my existence.

They would have laughed at you, just like everyone else is doing. But it does sound like you have a good handle on your net worth as a human being.

_Everybody_ else? I can't take a break from laughing at you "DANGEROUS" man. Do your gonads swell whenever you type your moniker?

Texas has one of the most liberal gun laws in the country, yet it did little good in this case.

Jesus was never in the bar and didn't know what had happened in there. He was inside playing video games and had gone outside to move his car when he encountered the two. Whatever happened then is what lead up to the shooting. After shooting he immediately called the police and waited for them. Doesn't sound like somebody who just wanted to shoot two guys for no reason.

Suspicious is why Jesus felt he needed to "move his car" at that particular time. And John's relative's statement about what she overheard on the cell phone call moments before John was shot. And the fact that John had been shot through the windshield of his car. And that both victims were unarmed. But still, I see your point about reasonable doubt.

Actually it doesn't and they were far LESS liberal at the time of the shooting. Thus they changed them after the shooting. Texas remains one of a handful of states that bans open carry and requires guns to be concealed.
