BB has been killed in Rawapindi Pakistan about an hour ago. Was it ALQ? Pakistani military, ISI or the NWO order? Opinions?

I knew this lady as she use to speak to our students on a regular basis; well educated and well meaning she always struck me as elitist but a strong supporter of women's rights in Islam and of progressive democracy.

Jim Fetzer will shortly publish a book proving it was the work of the Bush Administration.

Well it could have been anyone...except Islamic fundamentalists, of course; they never blow up anything.

The elections were to be held on Jan 9. Bhutto comes back as the opposition leader. She's polling over 60%. There's a terrible bombing the day she comes back. She continues to get death threats. Her police detail is reduced. Sad that it was so inevitable.

It's hard to tell. He indeed is a favorite, but Pakistani extremists didn't like Bhutto any more than they like him and I don't think it was in Mushy's best interests in the long run.

Why make a martyr out of her?

It makes more sense that Islamic extremists are trying to kill two birds with one stone. Get rid of a potential prime minster they didn't want, and turn the tide of public opinion against Mushy because people will blame him automatically.

That's the beauty of having the only tactic in a conflict of 'stirring the pot'; you can do pretty much anything.
