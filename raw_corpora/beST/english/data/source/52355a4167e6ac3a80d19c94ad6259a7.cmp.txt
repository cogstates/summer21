So, in order to not appear the self-righteous hypocrite, you are fighting to keep all of those groups from being afforded civil marriage licenses.

Right?

(BTW, are you aware that one of the fastest growing businesses catering to gay clientele is the Retirement Community business?....so much for "dieing fairly young")

I've always been a critic of judges who decide they are going to disregard the will of legistlatures and the populace and impose these things, but here's a case where they did it the right way, they passed a bill, and Christie the Hutt decides he's stull sucking up to be RomBot's running mate.

Oh shut the fuck up...

Yeah, kinda like prop 8 that was democratically voted on?? or Walker up in Wisconsin who was democratically elected, then passed an anti-collective bargaining law in which democrats ran to Illinois and are now trying to recall him??

How about Obama threatening to veto any bill that is passed by the House that makes it passed Senate??????

But yeah, I bet no leftist slime fuck would have a problem with Obama vetoing a bill..

As usual progressives are pathetic fucks...

So what is the difference? If Alcoholics die fairly young, Drug users die fairly young, Smokers die fairly young, Obese people die fairly young and homosexuals die fairly young. Why is it only one of the identified groups is being barred from Civil Marriage (in most places).

Then logic dictates that it is not the "unhealthly lifestyle" which is the reason for barring them from Civil Marriage when others who live unhealthy lifestyles are not barred from Civil Marriage.

The reality is that "unhealthy lifestyle" is a dodge, a rationalization because it is not logically supported.

HIV/AIDS related deaths were 16,789 (the lowest of the listed groups), with smoking related deaths were 394,195 (the highest). People are 2347.94 times more likely to die from smoking then from being a homosexual. Yet smokers are allowed to Civilly Marry but homosexuals are not (in most places). The argument that the focus is that it is more "unhealthy" does not ring true.

How many times do I have to say that gay's should have their rights under the law?
I bet you that they did not run around on their partners either and that's how they made it to a ripe old age.

Yes, you cant violate anothers constitutional rights, voting like prop 8 in cali was just that.im not sure how many times this has to be told to you people, but seriously buy a clue.

Where do you find a right in the Constitution? Without using interpretation, show me where you think that the right to be married lies in the Constitution? Better yet, show me where that authority is taken away from the states?

You are correct. The power for that has been left to the states. (Or we could just vote to have the state the hell out of our vows and have all marriages treated like contracts?)
