My boyfriend does graphics for Barry Cooper (the ex-DEA cop who now makes documentaries based around marijuana-Never Get Busted and Never Get Raided) and we met him for the first time at the premiere public screening of Never Get Raided this past Saturday in Dallas. Ever since then, I've been drooling like a rabid squirrel. I've suddenly become infatuated with this guy. But I feel so good...like a kid again with a silly crush and fantasy. Of course, nothing will ever come from these crazy feelings, he's 17 years my senior and married to his soulmate and I'm in love with my boyfriend. It's just wild, but maybe I'm just star-struck. He's the closest thing to a celebrity that I've ever known. He's been on 20/20, MSNBC, CNN, Geraldo...not necessarily famous, but getting there. But good god the things I would do to that man if all of the situations I just listed off weren't so. Haha.
