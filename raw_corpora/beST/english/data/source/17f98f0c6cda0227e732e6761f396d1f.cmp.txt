I have tickets to this Friday's Brewers/Cubs game but the memory of my three hour nightmare getting to Miller Park last time is making me nauseous.

Does anyone have suggestions about a more efficient way to get to the stadium on game day than slogging on the Interstate with a bunch of cargo-short/flip-flop wearing, Jeep Wrangler driving, backward hat styling, Illinoisans? Buses? Alternate routes? Rocket-fueled jet-pack?

Any assistance would be much appreciated.

Got in and out with relative ease the last time I went. (Sold out game).

Get there early and tailgate.

Coming from the west isn't usually too terrible. Traffic tends to back up near the National Cemetery before the game but it has never been more than a 15-30 minute wait to get parked for us. I've had problems leaving from the parking lot across the Interstate but usually we try to show up early and leave later.

I tried an alternative route once last year, taking Bluemound in from Goerkes Corner after meeting up with someone there, but it seemed longer and I didn't get out any quicker.
