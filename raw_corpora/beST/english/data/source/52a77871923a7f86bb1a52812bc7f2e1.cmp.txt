this is a ridiculous comparison, and I have to wonder why you would go to such lengths to make excuses for the guy.

I would not. I find it interesting that people keep assuming this because I point, as others have, to the social sciences for understanding these actions. It is disappointing because I really wanted people to focus on the facts and not my personal opinion on it all (more on that later).

First off, the people in Nazi Germany had been brainwashed for decades, with Nazi propaganda promoted to kids from the cradel. Kids were even told to inform on their parents if they started telling them anti-Nazi ideology, so you had a situation where parents saw their own children being bred into Nazis by the state but felt powerless to try and stop it.

Second of all, not collaberating with the Nazis had enormous repreccusions. You or your sons could be sent to the Russian front. You could end up in a concentration camp, or prison, or summarily executed. You could lose your job at a time and place where starvation was rampant, and your family could die if you lost your job.

That was absolutely nothing like what this guy faced. He was not brought up in a culture where child rape is acceptable. He was not risking his life to help the child. the very worst thing that could have happened to him is that he would not be believed and he could loose a job. And this isn't winter in Nazi Germany in 1941. Losing your job does not have the same consequences.

Wah, sorry, I must have written that unclearly. I was trying to argue against a famed moral dilemma that has people in their armchairs pontificating that they would never turn in Jews, etc. You are exactly right about the influences at play that lead to normal people behaving in such an abnormal manner.

And the reason people are focussing so much on the GA is with the actual perpetrator, well he's clearly just an evil person. Evil people do evil things and what else can you say about it? But by his own admission, the GA was very distraught over what he saw. He knew he saw something horrible. He wasn't some low life sociopath or masochist. That makes him failing to act much, much worse. He was exactly the kind of person who could and should have interceeded.

</quote>
Agreed.

<quote>
This idea about "not comprehending what he was seeing" or "thinking he was hallucinating" really is a ridiculous stretch, and I don't see how someone could go to such lengths to excuse him.

</quote>
To that extent, yes.

<quote>
And the fact that his father is saying that "he did exactly what he was supposed to" and making it seem like the GA is himself a victim in all of this - Mary stating that he is a victim in all this, is simply disgusting. This guy was not a victim. Seeing something difficult does not make you a victim. This guy was not some 12 year old kid, he was a grown man who could have intervened, and did not. He was a coward, and there is no excuse for him.

Calling him a victim, Mary, is simply beyond terrible. That child was a victim of both his rapist, and the man who saw him and did nothing. The child was his victim, this guy was a victim of nothing but his own cowardice and moral failings.

I agree. My problem hasn't been with any of this, but the way people have been acting like his failing was some unthinkably extreme character deficiency. My real position is that human nature is horrible, from our rational moral principle perspective. This man's character is no more scummy than one's neighbour, who honestly is probably sitting on a similar story about Uncle Joe. And by "no more" I mean just as scummy, just under the right bizarre influences.

When I was having sex at eight, people "knew". It is an age old story because human nature doesn't change. So people can leap onto their high horses and espouse moral dictums, but I will be skeptical.

I'm sorry that you were abused, but I disagree with your viewpoint. I believe it's our tendency to make excuses, to forgive those not upholding our morals, avoiding accountability, and lauding the protectionism of authority that create this tendency towards inaction. We have to reward the good and point out the bad: hold them up in the light and declare this is who we really are.
