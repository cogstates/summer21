DAMASCUS, (PIC)-- A Palestinian source, close to Hamas movement, said that Khaled Mishaal, the chairman of the political bureau of Hamas, has no intention of running for Hamas chairmanship in the next elections.

The source, who refused to be identified, told the PIC on Tuesday that Mishaal would not accept nomination for the top post in the movement.

Senior officials in Hamas had earlier denied press reports that Mishaal would nominate himself for chairmanship of the Palestinian national council, or Palestinian parliament in exile, in the upcoming elections.
