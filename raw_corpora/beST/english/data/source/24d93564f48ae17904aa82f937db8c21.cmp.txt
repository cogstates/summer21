The existence of 2 (presumably) youngish children would suggest that the marriage is not the cold and unrewarding one the husband would have you believe. The oldest child is at university, the youngest will be starting A levels this year

You have no evidence whatsoever that his home life is barren and unhappy. If it was so desperate, so stultifying, so lacking in affection, he would have told her and taken steps to end the marriage... for his own sake! Perhaps, but perhaps not

If you think she just needs the gentlest of nudges to decide that the marriage isn't worth salvaging, why not drop her a line and ask her what she thinks about the present situation and how best to resolve the difficulties. It's not my place to tell her and nor would I, under any circumstances

If he wants to end the marriage and be with me, then that's his decision

You're right I do have conflicting feelings. I can't carry on as I am, so I do need to know what his long term intentions are. I might not like the answer, but I know I do have to find out.

Good luck with that. He can tell you anything he thinks will keep you pacified.

Leaving aside the morality of affairs for a moment, I wonder how you could be happy being treated this way by any man. It seems to me that you fit in around his life, when it suits him then you can meet up? We meet when it is convenient to both of us If it isn't too personal a question, what do you do? Find a room? Nope, as I have said before we haven't been up to much of that. The few times it has happened has been when he's visiting me and there's been no one in at my house I'm sorry but from here it all seems a little tawdry - don't you deserve better than this? Yes, and i'd like more than that too

As for affairs, well, my Mum had one when I was 16 and left my Dad. I was devastated at the time - called her some names that even now I blush to recall but with the benefit of maturity and some distance I can see that it was the best decision for all concerned. My Mum married the other man and stayed with him until he died. My Dad met a lovely woman and also remarried. My sister and me, after a tumultuous month or two, got on with our lives. Affairs do cause a lot of emotional upheaval and unhappiness but the long term outcome doesn't necessarily need to be a bad one.

I don't mean to be dense, but why do you have to find out what HIS long term intentions are? What are YOURS?

I would be more concerned with his short term intentions to be honest,you could spend years listening to excuses and waiting for him to leave.

Are you really happy with the possibilty of waiting for all that time only to be in the exact same position years from now?

If you want to be with him you do have to lay your cards on the table,you have to mean it too and be prepared to walk away if he isn't commited to leaving his marriage in the near future.

My husband had a three and a half year affair. He promised her the world, and on the basis of this, she had his baby. He didn't leave me, had no intentions of doing so. She was a convenient physical repository, someone to talk to, someone who thought that the sun shone out of his backside, and he basked in the adulation. When push came to shove, he chose to stay with me. I chose to allow him to do so. I did, however, keep in contact with his mistress, as much to get answers to my myriad of questions as to keep an eye on her. (she was so smitten that she turned down a chance to emigrate to NZ and made a million and one excuses for him when heir child died without him even bothering to visit her ) And, funnily enough, she was shocked when I told her of the affairs he had following the demise of their relationship ; she truly thought that she was the one, rather than a convenience.
