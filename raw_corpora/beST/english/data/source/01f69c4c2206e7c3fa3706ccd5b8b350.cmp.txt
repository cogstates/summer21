Oh, this is cute. They just had to overturn an election in Lee County (the South Carolina county where the sheriff just got busted for his involvement in the drug business) because they got 107% turnout.

The simplest record method is that you get a printed receipt that you can verify matches your intended vote, but without your name on it. Then you drop that receipt into a box before leaving the polling place. This would be just like the manual voting cards we used prior to the machines.

If there is any funky number business, then the receipts can be counted by hand. That's a manual recount.

If you really want to have fun, print the receipts as scantron forms.

Then there is a recountable record that does not have the voter's ID associated, but the voter checks before submitting, that is independent of the electronic record in the machines and any code finagling and whatnot.

I don't think we can rely on voting machines when they have no way to verify the count. The head of Diebold said his mission was to see that Bush was re-elected. He did not say he wanted to have a great working machine. What does it take for us to shit can them?

Diebold no longer makes voting machines. That part of its business was spun off into a separate company called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_Election_Solutions">Premier Election Solutions</a> in 2007, and that in turn was bought another company called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Systems_%26_Software">Election Systems &amp; Software</a> in 2009. So you don't have to be scared of the Diebold boogeyman anymore.

The bigger part of Diebold's business, by far, is ATM machines.

<a href="http://www.bradblog.com/?p=7906">http://www.bradblog.com/?p=7906</a> Totally inadequate response. The voter machine companies are p[laying musical chairs and who knows who actually owns what? But our machines are now mostly in hands of Canadian and Venezuelan companies. Can that be justified? We are talking about election credibility. The machines should not be in private hands.
