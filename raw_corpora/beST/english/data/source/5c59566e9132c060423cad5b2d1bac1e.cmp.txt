And although I havn't finished it, I can say it is a decent book. Fast Paced. Great Plot.

But anyone who buys the theories and "history" of this book needs to do some reading that doesn't come from the section in a Grocery store line next to the M&amp;Ms.

I liked it too, the writing wasn't great but it was a good read. I agree about the theories and history too! It's straight out of "Holy blood, Holy Grail", did anyone ever read that book?

I'm reading it now. I'm a fan of alternative histories, and this is among the oldest ones in the Christian tradition. To be quite truthful its been around far longer than "Holy Blood, Holy Grail." In fact Merovich claimed to be descended from Christ according to more than one account.

The history of it is utter hogwash (the canon wasn't even voted on at Nicea). However it is a good plot and a fastpaced read. I'm severely dyslexic and made it through it in under a week.

I enjoyed it ' t'was very readable, and a good work of fiction. I just wish more people would realise that that's what it is.

Fortunately, most of us probably know enough about our faith not to fall here.

Unfortunately not every Christian Does.... That is what is concerning.

Atheiests think we are all suckers, so if we look overly paranoid about some popular book or movie - it will confirm their suspicions.

indeed so Gtsecc.

I would add that it is important that we do read the book, and if we can't do that at least watch the movie (it really is a much better book). How can we answer sincere question about the faith when we don't even know the questions?

After you finish it, I suggest you get "Angels and Demons" next. You will probably find, like many of us that have read both books, that A&amp;D is actually the better of the two.

I just might, I am thoroughly enjoying The code.

What about his book about the digital hacking? I think it was written before A&amp;D.

Okay, I'll steer clear of that one, but I'll look at A&amp;D.

Cola, now you see why it is sucha good book. I guessed it like three chapters before they told you--but still, that's aways into the book.

He does at least know how to do suspense fiction.

That he does sir, that he does.

While we are on the topic of suspense novels, what else do you guys like?

While not necessarily the same type of suspense, Jurrassic Park was awesome.

The movie pales in comparison. Most movies are weak compared to the book, but this moreso.

That brings up another topic, was the Da Vinci movie any good? I haven't seen it.

Actually, I liked "Digital Fortress". I found it difficult to put down. I also liked "Deception point". So I have read all four of his books and enjoyed them. Having read all four, I will admit that the only drawback to Brown's style is that his books seem to have been written on a template. They all follow the same format. You'll understand what I mean after you read 2 or 3 of them.
