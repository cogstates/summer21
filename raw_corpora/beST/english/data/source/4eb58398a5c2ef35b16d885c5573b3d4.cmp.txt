Hey the FOXNEWS watchers and defenders.

Have the FOXNEWS covered the latest news in the case...the video which shows that the killer, George Zimmerman doesn't appear to have a scratch or at least not anything indicating being hurt directly after being arrested?

Did any of their actual news anchors covered it? How about their pundits?

Anyone...?

They covered that this morning.

sorry ya racist fuck, but FOX has covered it on every single last show, that I have seen.

Pity you suck so fucking much that honesty can't seep in.

But you keep praying for Zimmerman to get killed. I'm sure Satan answers prayers as well.

They didn't cover it yesterday.
So they were an entire day late in a BIG news story.
That is equivalent to like a week in the news business.
And they're supposed to be the number one news network.
Why is that?
Could it be that they were waiting to get their talking points and marching orders sorted out?
Hmmmmm.....?

So what did they say anyway? I'm curious to know.

Your claims are completely inacurate. I know that from simple observation. I saw about an hour total on it on FNC yesterday, and there wre various invterviews including the lawyer(s) for the family of the victim

They showed the video just like all the other news did yesterday and then said that the video was to grainy to make any judgment and people should wait until the medical reports about it come out.

Ahhh....

Yes, they've got their talking point sorted out. Pretty much all the RWers were repeating that meme yesterday...."it's too grainy, so we should wait."

Of course they want to wait, that video is damning.

Thanks for your response though.

It's the biggest, hottest news story in media.

Are they not a media company interesting in keeping the populate updated on the latest and greatest and hottest news?

Any of you wager to guess why such little coverage for the biggest, most powerful media organization on the world?

The story is aimed at you, Marccy, the red meat in your racialist worldview.

The story is pumped by those who what a virtual race-war, who prosper when the races are at each other' throats.

Wise up.

Excuse me miss, but what does that word mean?

</quote>

Racialist....one to whom race is the determining factor in analyzing events and relationships.

ra·cial·ism (rsh-lzm)
n.
1.
a. An emphasis on race or racial considerations, as in determining policy or interpreting events.
b. Policy or practice based on racial considerations.

Think that is a wise basis for decisions?

Zora Neale Hurston was right, All your skin folks aint your kin folks. And all your color aint your kind!

Hurston was a Republican who was generally sympathetic to the Old Right and a fan of Booker T. Washington's self-help politics. She disagreed with the philosophies (including Communism and the New Deal) supported by many of her colleagues in the Harlem Renaissance.

You're being used, Marccy....
....the story is used to plant the seed that you must vote for the black candidate because of all those vicious white racists who are out to get you...

George Zimmerman... 'white ' Hispanic.....get it?
