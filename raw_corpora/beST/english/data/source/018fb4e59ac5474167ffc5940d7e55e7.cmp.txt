Americans and foreigners of the muslim faith were murdered on 9/11. These muslims are as much victims of the islamist terrorists as all the others, the Christians, the Jews, the Hindus, the Atheists.

Muslims in lower Manhattan go to a mosque or prayer room there, because that's where they live ot work. These Muslims are New Yorkers! Just like all the others: The Christians, the Jews, the Hindus, the Atheists.

When the planes crashed, when the towers fell, there were tens of thousands of muslim New Yorkers in downtown Manhattan, very nearly becoming victims of the atrocities.

Now Chewy_Defense wants to make these New Yorkers, these victims of 9/11, victims again. Victims of past terrorists, and victims of future terrorists.

Up to this point, excellent post. From this point on, crap.

Chewy_Defense seems to hate the freedom that the Constitution grants to all Americans.

</quote>
Bull. He's shown no signs of hating anyone or anything. He respects Constitutional freedoms but sees possible harm to NYC should the full extent of those freedoms be exercised by building this Muslim complex. Like you, I think he is 100% wrong but all he is doing is expressing the fact that his values within those freedoms indicate a different course of action. That's all.

Chewy_Defense wants the terrorists to win. It's like he allows them to piss on the graves of muslim New Yorkers.

</quote>
More bull. He does not want the terrorists to win and your just throwing flame bait to make the claim. He identifies one possible harm and wants to minimize the chances of that happening. Now you and I disagree with him on the potential of that happening and the concomitant damage that will occur if his solution is implemented but that in no way implies his desire for a terrorist victory. Shame on you.

I'm still waiting for JihadJane's answer, as to why Al Qaeda attacked the USA on 9-11-01.

Maybe I should have split the two parts.
The latter is mocking Chewy's "arguments".

I do. More or less.
I'd explicitly mention US support for non-democracies like the monarchies of Saudi-Arabia, Jordan, Morocco, or the de-facto-dictatorship of Egypt.

They attacked in large part because of (A) USA's relationship/defense of Israel, and (B) the perceived USA Invasion, both Physically (as seen in Kuwait) and mentally of the middle east (as seen in the United Emeriates), etc...

And at the same time declared war on the Saudi king because he allowed us bases in the holy kingdom to help us fight Gulf War 1 and for us to defend the kingdom.

I agree with it also; pro-Israel/Mideast presence. Their hating our freedoms had very little, if anything, to do with it.

Plus KSM had an extreme hatred toward Americans from his college experience in North Carolina.

Can you really blame him on that one? One can take only so much NASCAR before wanting to kill someone...

(Disclaimer: I do watch an occasional NASCAR race and enjoy them when I do. Moderation is key. Much like moonshine and the Judds)
