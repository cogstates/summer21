Sorry, liar, but the case that was brought and won against the NBP was DISMISSED by the direct orders of the RACIST Eric Holder.

The Bush administration’s Justice Department — not the Obama administration — made the decision not to pursue criminal charges against members of the New Black Panther Party for alleged voter intimidation at a polling center in Philadelphia in 2008

You mad?

Nope, sorry, liar... You a dumbass...

The U.S. Department of Justice seal bears a Latin phrase: "Qui Pro Domina Justitia Sequitur." The motto refers to the attorney general, "who prosecutes on behalf of Lady Justice." But under President Barack Obama's politically corrupt DOJ, Lady Justice is getting the shaft.

To wit: Let's examine the uproar over Attorney General Eric Holder's decision to protect hate-mongering thugs who harassed and bullied precinct workers and voters on Election Day in Philadelphia. Oh, wait. There's been no uproar. Let me tell you why.

Two weeks ago, in a highly unusual move, Holder dismissed default judgments his department had won against two of three defendants charged with violating the Voting Rights Act. On Nov. 4, 2008, a billy club-wielding militant in military-style boots and beret stood outside a Philly polling location with a similarly dressed partner.

Bush DOJ decided there was no case there.

Had it been any one of those other palookas, say, Cain'n'Palin the country would have been in shambles.

Obama has pulled the country back from the brink of disaster that Bush'n'Cheney had left it in.

He's created ObamaCare, because, as we all know, Obama cares.

He's brought dignity back to the Office.

The economy has been steadily ticking up.

He saved GM...a WHOPPING success.

He got Bin Laden from a place that Bush didn't dare to go into. Khaddaffi's gone. Pirates of the seas know they can't 'EFF around with Americans or any of their properties.

He helped to liberate a country from a tyrant w/o spending too much time, money and with no casualties.

The rest of the world knows the same. Although he's not going around screaming about how big'n'tuff 'Murrka is.

He's pulling us out of war.

And, once again, the economy continues to tick up, despite his opponents in the GOP's efforts to undermine him at every. single. turn.

Yeah...I'd say Obama's a shoe-in for the next election.

Not to mention, History is going to be VERY kind to Obama...unlike the last guy.

I guess if you ignore the fact that he can't submit budgets...is the first American President to have our credit rating downgraded...ran up more debt in a shorter amount of time than anyone in history...has a "signature" piece of legislation, ObamaCare, that not only doesn't lower health care cost but is probably the most badly written law ever and will be ruled unconstitutional...appointed the same man who got Marc Rich off for a lump sum payment to the Clintons as his Attorney General...appointed a man who couldn't figure out TurboTax as our Treasury Secretary...fast tracked Solyndra and made it the "showcase" of his green jobs initiative...spent a trillion dollars on his "stimulus" only to see unemployment go from 8% to over 10...stonewalled drilling permits in the Gulf and the oil pipeline to placate his environmental base while throwing tens of thousands of jobless Americans under the bus...gave us expensive programs like Cash for Clunkers that ate up billions of taxpayer dollars and didn't jumpstart the economy...has deteriorated our relationship with Israel to it's worst state ever while he tried to "reason" with Iran...has no coherent energy policy...no coherent housing policy...no coherent trade policy...has shown absolutely no ability to forge a bipartisan approach to governing...and has spent the majority of his time campaigning for a second term rather than doing the actual job of President. Other than all that...he's just great, Marc!!!
