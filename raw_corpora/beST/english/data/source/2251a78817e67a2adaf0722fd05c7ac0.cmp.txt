well then youve obviously been brought up to hate the monarchy and you need to re-assess your views.

indeed, the monarchy is technically theocratic but thats it has evolved over the centuries - it used to be an absolute monarchy and is now just a constitutional one, we can keep our traditions as long as they evolve to meet the needs of the current generation. an atheist monarch will come along sooner or later it doesnt require scrapping of the whole institution.

and we dont need her but as i said, she is a source of national pride, distinctiveness, a symbol of our heritage and brings in tourism revenue.

and lastly.. the queen is the best person for the job.

the queen making a visit to the republic was a big deal, there were some protests from hardliner irish republicans, and general apathy from the rest of the population.
but the irish were bowled over when queen came over and paid her respects to irishmen who fought for britain and those who fought for independence from britain, to her bowing in honour of the victims of the first bloody sunday to even ex-IRA members. most people in england and ireland agreed her laying the wreath and paying her respects was a great moment in anglo-irish relations - a lot of irish people said it drew a line under things.

now imagine if an elected nobody, perhaps even if david cameron took on the role of president as well as prime minister, would anyone cared or even have noticed if cameron went to ireland to lay down a wreath? would the irish have considered david cameron coming over to lay a wreath it a big step foward in irish-english reconcilliation?

NO

the queen is the best abassador this country could ever have. she is in a symbolic role and no one has more symbolic pull than her given her familys history - traced back from william the conquer.

have i convinced you yet? <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

No you haven't convinced me, that is one act which I agree is good, but does not mean that it is the reason why we should keep a monarchy.

I havent been brought up with any views my family are also divided over the monarchy, I have just looked at the situation from a neutral point of view and come to the view that we do not need a monarchy. Also I wouldn't advise it be best to have David Cameron filling both roles, we need two different people for each role. Yes it is a BIG part of out history and i am proud of our history and the importance of what they did, and i think the monarchy did a goodish job in the previous centuries, but now in the modern world, we do not need them.

well if TSR found out your mother was seriously ill (not wishing bad health on her)you wouldnt expect me to say &amp;quot;frankly there are so many people far more ill than her, just because she happens to be the parent of someone on TSR she doesn't deserve any more care than any other person&amp;quot;

hes the husband of our head of state. try and dissasociate yourself with them as much as possible, youre from manchester so maybe its the plastic paddy syndrome...

A close member of my family is in fact in hospital over Christmas, but I don't request the sympathy of the nation, so your comparison doesn't work. To me, Prince Philip just happens to be the husband of some woman I neither know nor esteem, because all she did was.. be born to a privileged family. I wish him well just as I would any other stranger's husband.

As for your Manchester quip, I don't even know what stereotype you're working towards, but I can assure you I do not fit it, and it shows the weakness of your argument if you feel you have to make judgmental comments about my region on the country to back yourself up.

so because we dont NEED them is enough of a reason to scrap a tradition which many people in this country have a great affection for and affinity to?

There are other reasons too, but the main ones is that we dont need them, it also is undemocratic and on a personal note, as an aethiest i cannot agree with anyone appointed into a postion such as the head of state by god as i do not believe he is real.
