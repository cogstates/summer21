Yes because that is a very clever statement to make.

The fact is Royal Security are the ones massively at fault and they should have never taken Prince Charles &amp; Camilla down that route.

They were clearly taken that way to provoke students and make them out to look bad.

Well done politicians and media for being successful at portraying all students to be thugs.

I hope all of you who have branded students thugs never ever need a life saving operation because it will be a past student (graduate) carrying out the procedure to save your life - but then again why should you deserve help from people you branded as thugs?

The police are the legalised thugs in all this and they make me absolutely sick.
I hope the Army kettle and beat the hell out of police officers when they are rioting about being laid off and cuts are being made to the police budget. Lets see how they react when the tables are turned and they are putting in strikes which are far more damaging and cost the taxpayer more.

Whole country and system is a joke. Can't wait to get my degree and get out of this **** hole to pay tax where people respect students for trying to learn. I won't be paying tax to help those moaning about today's students. Save your own pension because I won't be paying for it and I hope other students don't pay for it.

What was Camilla doing with her window wound down. Was she trying to kidnap a protester?

They had someone on the news today pointing out that they had armed guards in there, and had things really kicked off he said AND I QUOTE: "It could have ended in tragedy, if they had been using petrol instead of paint, those armed guards might have been within their rights to shoot them"

Beyond that, I think students need to go about their means a different way. When the idiots who don't represent the protestors start kicking off, protestors should just sit down... Or avoid the whole situation altogether by doing something really positive. Like getting all those who oppose the tuition fee rises to give blood on the same day. One of the reasons students are supposed to be so great is because they are innovative. Channel all of that to a modern way of protesting which means that the cause can not be hijacked and I believe that they will be much more succesful (although I completely disagree with them)

It is disgraceful, but I must admit I couldn't suppress a giggle when I saw the photo of them on the cover of the Metro this morning.
