there was an accident in town with a catbacker bus (KSU fans) that went under a bridge that connected dorms....... some people were on the very top of the bus (which they shouldnt be, while the vehicle is moving), anyways, one person had what the paper called "a head injury" which was decapitation <img src="images/smilies/frown.gif"/> and the other was in critical condition......

thats a real downer...... especially after your team loses, then you lose your head <img src="images/smilies/frown.gif"/> that is really unfortunate.

I had a friend that i worked with many years ago. He was decapatated after his mini truck went under a diesel. Poor guy. They said he didnt feel any pain.

and needless to say, there was no open casket.
