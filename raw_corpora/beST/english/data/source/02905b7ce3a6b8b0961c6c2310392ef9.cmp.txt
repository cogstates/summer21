The Jewish minority in Finland at the time was small, 1,500 (of total population of 3.5 million), of whom some 350 served in the three Finnish "WWII" wars, the Winter War, the Continuation War, and the Lapland War; 23 gave their life for defending their home country. Quite a few were promoted Captains. Salomon Klass is perhaps the most notable, as a commander of a battalion. Please note that there were no seperate "Jewish" battalion or regiment and no segregation based on religion or some such, rather all Finnish soldiers served in their own "home" battalions and units.

While many Finnish women, too, contributed by serving in a voluntary auxiliary paramilitary home guard for women called the "Lottas" (after Lotta Svärd), Finnish women of Jewish faith were not granted an entry until after the Winter War when the Lotta organization first granted membership to two Finnish ladies of Muslim faith (Tatars, another Finnish minority, who also served on the front as Finnish soldiers). Since the Lotta pledge was given in the (Lutheran) church with a promise to defend "religion, home and homeland," prejudices lingered whether the non-Christian Finns could be trusted to take the pledge. Unfortunately, I can't seem to find the number of women of Jewish faith who served in the Continuation and Lapland wars.

Indeed, three Finns of the Jewish community were awarded with the German Iron Cross, but none were accepted. Captain Leo Skurnik (who as a medic saved several German lives), Captain Salomon Klass and Dina Poljakoff, a female Lotta.

The improvised Finnish Jewish field/tent synagogue in Syväri, 1942-44:

Films to watch:

The Unknown Soldier ( Tuntematon sotilas <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048752/">1955</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090215/">the 1985 remake</a> ).

Based on the highly regarded novel by Väinö Linna. Both versions are excellent and considered "a must" in Finland.

Highly recommended! This is a commercial action/war film, but it also has beautiful Biblical scenes and themes interwowen in it (as hinted by the cross on display on the hero's neck in the promotinal poster).

Also rather thick with a Christian message, as hinted by the title.

Hi Kalevalatar,

Thanks for posting your material - very interesting.
Undoubtedly you have more than just a slight personal interest in Finlands history whereas someone like myself from Australia, it tends to be more academic but even so I was surprised that I came across this information as late as I have.

Leaving aside the fact that Finland was fighting for its very survival; for me the situation is absolutely fascinating as it blurs the border between the supposed good side and the bad side.

Even though I would have supported the Russians against the Germans in general and especially with the German attack on Stalingrad; if I were to have crossed into Finland I probably would have ended up supporting some of the German regiments which were fighting alongside Finish units against Soviet aggression toward Finland. Of course whenever these units moved back into Norway then these same German units would then become the enemy.

Even though we are talking about human calamity and suffering, the complexities regarding Finlands involvement with Germany during this period is again a fascinating piece of history.

My understanding is that the US kept a legation in Finland up until about 6 months before D-Day, do you have any information on this?

Most importantly, do you have any information regarding the views that were held by the Christians during this time?
