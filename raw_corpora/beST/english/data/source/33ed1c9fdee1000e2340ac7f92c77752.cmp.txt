Why would you ask the Irish? The only people that should be asked is the northern Irish, do they want to be apart of the UK or Ireland. If you are going to ask the whole of Ireland then you should be asking the rest of the UK too

For Northern Ireland to be rejoined to the Republic there has to be a referendum in the Republic aswell, it's always been part of the peace process. It's a secondary referendum though, only held if Northern Ireland votes for unity. It's also not 100% guaranteed that the Republic would vote in favour of reunification given all the trouble it could cause; economically I don't think it'd be too tough, it's not East Germany we're talking about here but politically it'd be a nightmare.

I think the city name in my location gives it away, or do you not know where "Belfast" is? Of course I'm a new SF supporter, I'm not even 25. I can't comment on whether I'd've voted for them during the Troubles as I was only born near the end. Least I can remember it. Personally, given me uncle marches in the Orange Order and I've lost family members to the 'RA, it's bad enough, to my family, that I support them now. I've always wanted a United Ireland, though, all my life.

That's interesting, so you are a protestant background, Scots-Irish SF supporter?

Nah, it'll be the Kingdom of Great Britain if NI left. Great Britain has never been the UK.

</quote>

Yeah I know it was just the Kingdom of Great Britain before Ireland joined, but I doubt they'd change the name back to that if Northern Ireland left. It would be easier to keep it as the UK. The name would still make sense considering it's still the union of the former kingdoms of England and Scotland. Calling it the UK would probably fall out of use eventually, but that would happen gradually.

Why do you keep talking like you're some 50 year old, experienced IRA man, who endured all this hardship and oppression? You're a teenager behind a computer screen ffs.

</quote>

I don't think I talk like that tbh. I have learned a lot off many people with first hand experience.
Don't give me that "behind a computer" crap if you don't know me in real life.

Let me guess, you're 17/18 years old who happens to know a few older men who were involved with the provos/INLA and are feeding you a romanticised, one sided version of events. You've become overawed by all this bull**** romanticism and propaganda instead of using your brain, the sort of chap who sings "Go on home British soliders" when are no British soldiers on patrol in NI. You're being used - if you keep going like this it's likely you'll end up a member of the conties or ONH, cannon fodder for extremists. Wise up and snap out of it.

That post barley warrants a reply. Comic gold.
