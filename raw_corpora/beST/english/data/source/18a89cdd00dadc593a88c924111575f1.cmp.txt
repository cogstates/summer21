Huge Marijuana Bust, where Rap Producer: Kareem "Biggs" Burke of Rock-A-Fella Records and High Times Editor: Matthew Stang were busted in tandem for a Marijuana ring.

Talk about Ebony &amp; Ivory.

No charges filed for any cocaine, smack, chrystal meth of any other shit, just good old fashioned Grass, weed. kind bud, ect.

Jay Z. has not been charged.

News Releases featured the term: "manufacture" of marijuanna like a living plant has to be "manufactured". also featuring the term "drug" as to imply that narcotics might be involved.

Seems that the Feds seized about two million cash in marijuana proceeds.

Well our money hungry goverment has found another pretext to sieze money from well meaning capitalists.

If this is not prima face evidence for budget cuts and layoffs for self-important goverment activists looking to make work, and a name for themselves.

Was The Bust orchrestrated from survielance of the principals due to countercultural activities ? Is this some kind of vindictive pay-back against the marijuana culture activists?

A usefull prisism from which to view all of our goverment burecuracries, as a bunch of self-serving, money grubing pigs.

On another front: Attorney General Eric Holder is promising federal prosecution of marijuana consumption in California should the body politic pass proposition 19 to decriminilize marijuana in The State of California.

Well Fuck You too Eric Holder, and your boss too.

Perhaps its time for budget and personel cuts in the Justice Dept if all you have to do is bust for weed.

I do not know if there are any Hippies who visit this website, but if there are I am sure that you share my outrage.

If you are OK with all of this persecution and theft well, it remains a free speech forum and everybody is welcome to ther opinions.

This is where the diference between a Hippy and a hard-core Democratic activist becomes aparent.

Our White House can spend political capital on the issues that it choses to. That it has chosen to go against California voters is telling.

The locals charged me with that same thing in 2002, and took all of my money and guns out the door with my plants. Charges were dropped because of a bad search warrant, but I didn't get my guns and money back.
