and French President and German Chancellor as European Emperors. New European constitution (written by former French president d`Estaign) removes veto right from member countries. Every unpleasant government can be ignored and voted down (as Austria a few years ago). Every independent opinion (to world events) can be silenced by official foreign minister or President(named in fact by France and Germany). Europe will not be any democratic federation but real feudal Empire - no law for major countries (France and Germany ignore international treaty (Stability Pact) and reject to pay defined sanctions). New countries joined in fear from economical revenge for refuse. UK hoped that new countries help to break France-German hegemony in EU, but they are scared from them and never will vote against them. In Czech republic only 47% voted YES for EU and in other candidate countries is the number similar. Europe was united many times - Rome, Napoleon`s Empire, Hitler`s 3rd Reich. Millions of deads always followed the empires... Let see on Mr Chirac. Does he talking as elected representative of 50milions France citizens or talking as Lord of 500milions slaves in EU and adjacent countries (Ukraine, Turkey, Norway or Marocco)?

ya, there are a few sick people that don't care much for democracy and have some rather twisted ideals. unfortnaly they are often the ones in power; some of them even seem to want to make the eu into a <a href="http://www.write-on.co.uk/eurobabel_2.htm">new babylon.</a> [g)]

The thing i find most disturbing is that Tony is apparently considering to 'sign' the UK over to the french and germans, even though it will take away all of the governements power over all major decisions.

Sadly, the UK was very much in favour of the preservation of the vetos for the UK as a condition for greater entry into the EU.

The new constitution is pretty much an unhappy compromise - it displeases hardliners who want the EU to put centralised stability first, and it displeases the liberals who want a more loose europe.

ItÂ’s hard to understand why The Brits would desire to be assimilated into the EU. Whereas the continentals trade primarily among themselves, England has global trading partners. England is oil self-sufficient, the rest import. England has a comparative robust economy while the rest flounder. England has a wonderful history while the rest have dismal histories. England exported democracy across the planet while the rest contributed little or suffered under tyranny. England remains a world power, the rest degenerating under the yoke of socialism.
